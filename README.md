# codex-data
The new (and converted) Codex standoff documents can be found in the ```/data``` directory.

The new Codex editing environment is available at SPEEDY-TS repo: https://github.com/argimenes/speedy-ts

In the near future I will export the entities, traits, properties, and meta-relations from the old Codex Neo4j database, and these files will be kept in a directory I will call ```graphs```.
