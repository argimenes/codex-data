But first let me tell of the rooms in which it was held. There were seven — an imperial suite, In many palaces, however, such suites form a long and straight vista, while the folding doors slide back nearly to the walls on either hand, so that the view of the whole extant is scarcely impeded. Here the case was very different; as might have been expected from the duke's love of the \"bizarre.\" The apartments were so irregularly disposed that the vision embraced but little more than one at a time. There was a sharp turn at the right and left, in the middle of each wall, a tall and narrow Gothic window looked out upon a closed corridor of which pursued the windings of the suite. These windows were of stained glass whose color varied in accordance with the prevailing hue of the decorations of the chamber into which it opened. That at the eastern extremity was hung, for example, in blue — and vividly blue were its windows. The second chamber was purple in its ornaments and tapestries, and here the panes were purple. The third was green throughout, and so were the casements. The fourth was furnished and lighted with orange — the fifth with white — the sixth with violet. The seventh apartment was closely shrouded in black velvet tapestries that hung all over the ceiling and down the walls, falling in heavy folds upon a carpet of the same material and hue. But in this chamber only, the color of the windows failed to correspond with the decorations. The panes were scarlet — a deep blood color. Now in no one of any of the seven apartments was there any lamp or candelabrum, amid the profusion of golden ornaments that lay scattered to and fro and depended from the roof. There was no light of any kind emanating from lamp or candle within the suite of chambers. But in the corridors that followed the suite, there stood, opposite each window, a heavy tripod, bearing a brazier of fire, that projected its rays through the tinted glass and so glaringly lit the room. And thus were produced a multitude of gaudy and fantastic appearances. But in the western or black chamber the effect of the fire-light that streamed upon the dark hangings through the blood-tinted panes was ghastly in the extreme, and produced so wild a look upon the countenances of those who entered, that there were few of the company bold enough to set foot within its precincts at all.\r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"b7d82229-551d-4525-910f-475dd184ef47","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":2118,"end":2130,"value":"c2f9d635-bc0f-41bb-9dfc-1efe0b61a46c","text":"black chambe","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"09966e0b-963c-4a97-9155-122727408a9d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":2395,"end":2397,"value":"c2f9d635-bc0f-41bb-9dfc-1efe0b61a46c","text":"it","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false}],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"f8d63783-c2ca-4d9b-aaad-b0a5daf3ef70","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"2949aabf-bf5f-4f0d-8edb-ba3c25fc5738","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"It was within this apartment, also, that there stood against the western wall, a gigantic clock of ebony.

But when the echoes had fully ceased, a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly, and made whispering vows, each to the other, that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then, after the lapse of sixty minutes (which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of Time that flies), there came yet another chiming of the clock, and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.\r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"cb9cd2b0-6718-4add-b10e-594e07655729","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":81,"end":103,"value":"8f552eba-9f62-4dbf-9423-7dd61bf779db","text":"gigantic clock of ebon","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"069e83c3-92d1-42ae-a4f8-029948e1b63b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":106,"end":108,"value":"8f552eba-9f62-4dbf-9423-7dd61bf779db","text":"It","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"aec6f6f3-4ad9-4064-b0dd-96685bddbb36","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":302,"end":306,"value":"8f552eba-9f62-4dbf-9423-7dd61bf779db","text":"cloc","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"9161497f-f535-431d-b079-c245e907c7fa","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":577,"end":584,"value":"7b482e4a-6298-41c2-b771-8e52c2711080","text":"waltzer","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"d349f63f-878e-48ad-aaaa-2b1d78fdd1cb","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":602,"end":606,"value":"7b482e4a-6298-41c2-b771-8e52c2711080","text":"thei","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"b20df5b4-71db-483c-9a29-ccee87654533","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":660,"end":676,"value":"7b482e4a-6298-41c2-b771-8e52c2711080","text":"whole gay compan","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"b24e53ba-2f9a-4341-97c7-b86a84ca41b8","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":707,"end":711,"value":"8f552eba-9f62-4dbf-9423-7dd61bf779db","text":"cloc","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"a0d94706-febe-4a69-9aed-da01f5fc044c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1121,"end":1125,"value":"8f552eba-9f62-4dbf-9423-7dd61bf779db","text":"cloc","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"ad9c6c2a-debc-470f-87a0-615b1e99f9f2","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1326,"end":1330,"value":"8f552eba-9f62-4dbf-9423-7dd61bf779db","text":"cloc","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false}],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"0589f3c6-2a6a-49a8-8c7d-87f98c4eab71","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"2a3c5217-b299-4bd2-8fb7-0a6b8e97c9aa","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"But, in spite of these things, it was a gay and magnificent revel.

Be sure they were grotesque. There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm — much of what has been seen in \"Hernani.\" There were arabesque figures with unsuited limbs and appointments. There were delirious fancies such as the madman fashions. There were much of the beautiful, much of the wanton, much of the bizarre, something of the terrible, and not a little of that which might have excited disgust. To and fro in the seven chambers stalked, in fact, a multitude of dreams. And these the dreams — writhed in and about, taking hue from the rooms, and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps. And, anon, there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet. And then, for a moment, all is still, and all is silent save the voice of the clock. The dreams are stiff-frozen as they stand. But the echoes of the chime die away — they have endured but an instant — and a light half-subdued laughter floats after them as they depart. And now the music swells, and the dreams live, and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever, taking hue from the many-tinted windows through which stream the rays of the tripods. But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven there are now none of the maskers who venture, for the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-colored panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appalls; and to him whose foot falls on the sable carpet, there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.\r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"94322f32-ac5e-4ea0-ad0b-64808bcb0a22","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":0,"end":1,"value":"5b249ba9-43be-4ded-b7da-0ed40e7623c0","text":"H","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"4e2cc407-78c8-4c11-b02c-67867f556d89","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":182,"end":193,"value":"7b482e4a-6298-41c2-b771-8e52c2711080","text":"masquerader","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"942c19b5-1020-4f4c-b8f6-abe4dc104c29","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":204,"end":207,"value":"7b482e4a-6298-41c2-b771-8e52c2711080","text":"the","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"933122dd-1e2e-48a6-8cec-b9173fc6f095","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":318,"end":324,"value":"6088c686-0b26-469e-838a-db2ded479444","text":"Hernan","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"bc1e4e7e-a646-448b-ac93-2178b47aa051","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":869,"end":879,"value":"8f552eba-9f62-4dbf-9423-7dd61bf779db","text":"ebony cloc","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"05beaa8a-735c-4c6f-9e53-734e17282577","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":999,"end":1003,"value":"8f552eba-9f62-4dbf-9423-7dd61bf779db","text":"cloc","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false}],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"94bb1b69-6bdc-4ef0-85bc-7480fa5a8698","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"73a1bd69-9546-4eb9-a7b9-a906551890bc","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"But these other apartments were densely crowded, and in them beat feverishly the heart of life.

In truth the masquerade license of the night was nearly unlimited; but the figure in question had out-Heroded Herod, and gone beyond the bounds of even the prince's indefinite decorum. There are chords in the hearts of the most reckless which cannot be touched without emotion. Even with the utterly lost, to whom life and death are equally jests, there are matters of which no jest can be made. The whole company, indeed, seemed now deeply to feel that in the costume and bearing of the stranger neither wit nor propriety existed. The figure was tall and gaunt, and shrouded from head to foot in the habiliments of the grave. The mask which concealed the visage was made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have difficulty in detecting the cheat. And yet all this might have been endured, if not approved, by the mad revellers around. But the mummer had gone so far as to assume the type of the Red Death. His vesture was dabbled in blood — and his broad brow, with all the features of his face, was besprinkled with the scarlet horror.\r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"36940e5c-bc50-4c89-88b2-8e8763a3ca76","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":6,"end":26,"value":"7b482e4a-6298-41c2-b771-8e52c2711080","text":"assembly of phantasm","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"5d7cb434-c45d-4854-9726-24d63acdda0e","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":214,"end":219,"value":"9544c6a3-1a96-4d31-8b1c-0df6c4bfb1e9","text":"figur","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"7284accb-440a-4f9f-afa3-a7e4925b0236","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":249,"end":253,"value":"c963d7be-1d7e-4688-af06-5c84b3e40375","text":"Hero","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"cc201dae-02b6-4d14-b8b3-4add7fc557b4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":295,"end":300,"value":"5b249ba9-43be-4ded-b7da-0ed40e7623c0","text":"princ","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"2360f433-641a-44a5-bb83-cacd8a73fc28","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":539,"end":551,"value":"7b482e4a-6298-41c2-b771-8e52c2711080","text":"whole compan","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"ba93d6d1-58ea-4e17-a775-2cd6cec88998","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":627,"end":634,"value":"9544c6a3-1a96-4d31-8b1c-0df6c4bfb1e9","text":"strange","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"87da8081-fe41-4105-b0b8-d9fae434471f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":675,"end":680,"value":"9544c6a3-1a96-4d31-8b1c-0df6c4bfb1e9","text":"figur","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"a0a67fa1-a5a6-4634-b486-19e71fd4d30a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1008,"end":1020,"value":"7b482e4a-6298-41c2-b771-8e52c2711080","text":"mad reveller","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"984b2ded-429b-48a5-b288-24ed2962a860","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1038,"end":1043,"value":"9544c6a3-1a96-4d31-8b1c-0df6c4bfb1e9","text":"mumme","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"d3435d01-42ce-4463-b7d0-f56d3d3af792","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1090,"end":1098,"value":"9544c6a3-1a96-4d31-8b1c-0df6c4bfb1e9","text":"Red Deat","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"22b31687-5864-423d-9039-4debbf923bdd","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1101,"end":1103,"value":"9544c6a3-1a96-4d31-8b1c-0df6c4bfb1e9","text":"Hi","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"a37586f0-db24-44ab-b748-accc629e0eb7","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1140,"end":1142,"value":"9544c6a3-1a96-4d31-8b1c-0df6c4bfb1e9","text":"hi","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"9ae115c0-1316-4949-888a-6f81eaf175f5","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1181,"end":1183,"value":"9544c6a3-1a96-4d31-8b1c-0df6c4bfb1e9","text":"hi","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false}],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"18e7888e-110a-40b9-8d1f-ee472cbc80a6","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"de356f7e-88c0-414a-9e40-96f5245c03bc","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"When the eyes of Prince Prospero fell on this spectral image (which, with a slow and solemn movement, as if more fully to sustain its role, stalked to and fro among the waltzers) he was seen to be convulsed, in the first moment with a strong shudder either of terror or distaste;

At first, as he spoke, there was a slight rushing movement of this group in the direction of the intruder, who, at the moment was also near at hand, and now, with deliberate and stately step, made closer approach to the speaker. But from a certain nameless awe with which the mad assumptions of the mummer had inspired the whole party, there were found none who put forth a hand to seize him; so that, unimpeded, he passed within a yard of the prince's person; and while the vast assembly, as with one impulse, shrank from the centers of the rooms to the walls, he made his way uninterruptedly, but with the same solemn and measured step which had distinguished him from the first, through the blue chamber to the purple — to the purple to the green — through the green to the orange — through this again to the white — and even thence to the violet, ere a decided movement had been made to arrest him. It was then, however, that the Prince Prospero, maddened with rage and the shame of his own momentary cowardice, rushed hurriedly through the six chambers, while none followed him on account of a deadly terror that had seized upon all. He bore aloft a drawn dagger, and had approached, in rapid impetuosity, to within three or four feet of the retreating figure, when the latter, having attained the extremity of the velvet apartment, turned suddenly and confronted his pursuer. There was a sharp cry — and the dagger dropped gleaming upon the sable carpet, upon which most instantly afterward, fell prostrate in death the Prince Prospero. Then summoning the wild courage of despair, a throng of the revellers at once threw themselves into the black apartment, and seizing the mummer whose tall figure stood erect and motionless within the shadow of the ebony clock, gasped in unutterable horror at finding the grave cerements and corpse-like mask, which they handled with so violent a rudeness, untenanted by any tangible
