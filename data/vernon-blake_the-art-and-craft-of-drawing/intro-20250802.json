Several of these treatises, of these volumes, I have read, still more have I glanced through; years ago I consulted with assiduity Marshall's Anatomy for Artists. Now, as a draughtsman of the nude myself, as a sculptor, as a painter, I have faults to find with one and all of the books on drawing that it has been my lot to come across. Some of them are practically valueless; others are fairly good; some, the artistic anatomies, I mean, fulfil rather too well their allotted task, but unfortunately the task that they have allotted themselves is far from coinciding with the extent of the subject of figure-drawing; and figure-drawing implicitly contains all other forms of drawing. I forget now which painter of seascapes was once asked what was the best way of learning to paint the sea. The churlish reply came: 'Go and draw the Antique!' This answer I would, myself, modify: I would replace the word 'Antique' by the word 'Nude'; why I would do so will appear hereafter.(1) For the moment I will return to my

us examine the case of the anatomists. I must hasten to say that, far from being hostile to anatomical studies, I favour them highly. It is many years since I read the often splendid, but as frequently inconsequent, prose of Ruskin. One thing, however, I remember among others: his denunciation of anatomical study. He named it as the cause of artistic decadence. Whether at some subsequent date (as was often his wont) he contradicted this statement, I know not. At any rate so great was his confusion of thought, that at the same date of writing, he, on the one hand, praised devout study, of hill-form or of flower by Turner or by Giotto, eulogized their minute knowledge of natural things, and the while condemned anatomical study, which is naught, after all, but more perfect knowledge and understanding of one part of natural manifestation—the part always to us the most interesting, for it constitutes our very being. I fear Mr. Ruskin would have been sore put to it to point out the exact degree to which he permitted nature study to be carried. What reply would he have made if a curious questioner had asked: 'Why, Mr. Ruskin, do you tell us to study with such intentness the working of the mechanical forces that shape a mountain, that govern the growth of trees, and at the same time do you discourage us from taking even a summary interest in the mechanical economy of the very remarkable machine that is the human body; to say nothing of the shapes and logical construction of animals?\r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"1abfe672-c19e-41c4-a164-fb8afb03b25a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":43,"end":43,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"85289015-a52e-493a-8a92-18afca22b492","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":43,"end":43,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"d87c84c8-06c0-4dca-b12c-7d48f912694b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":116,"end":116,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"6bf63d93-4882-4ad6-8b0b-08ef341c8adb","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":116,"end":116,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"4aa4ea25-451c-42ce-a2ce-2281c1ffa8e2","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":161,"end":161,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"1a73dd9e-c0e4-455a-a371-28514d905dd3","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":161,"end":161,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"41833da3-f096-42d9-99e4-49145e57a005","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":229,"end":234,"value":"f74f504d-60c1-480a-85a7-2beed6df792e","text":"Ruski","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"d6d4b249-c54d-462a-bd09-8dce7c87db1f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":257,"end":257,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"c8f5bf19-8ec0-40ef-9dae-c0637b5c546a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":257,"end":257,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"8cee4736-cc83-445f-b982-d980656d0232","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":456,"end":456,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"a88abcd2-6408-44f9-abc0-7aa445f22444","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":456,"end":456,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"6cbacdb5-422e-41c3-9e44-4b7c46eacc98","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":625,"end":630,"value":"02164603-021e-4dd4-9079-5a9b383430c3","text":"Turne","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"de378b73-46cf-4ab7-b2fa-036280966378","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":638,"end":643,"value":"40a9a37b-5ba1-497f-a11e-1cafcfd5aa23","text":"Giott","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"cbb6f5aa-2953-44cb-bca4-21d74842f2f6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":929,"end":929,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"189c07c0-206c-4b19-9ee0-e23c8746a1dd","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":931,"end":931,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"3635e495-dcb3-4874-90f2-a21b977bf1ad","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":940,"end":945,"value":"f74f504d-60c1-480a-85a7-2beed6df792e","text":"Ruski","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"e02e2add-4cd1-4451-9cb3-9c88540336a7","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1129,"end":1138,"value":"f74f504d-60c1-480a-85a7-2beed6df792e","text":"Mr. Ruski","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false}],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"4b4d6c23-858f-4c9f-8c52-8a17a4bf8064","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"459f70de-dbfc-46d0-8169-1da3b8d45cc0","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"The explanation of this incoherence on the part of Ruskin’s teaching is, I believe, threefold. First, he was incapable of concatenated thinking; he was a rash enthusiast, friend of the fervid and romantic word for its own sake; the co-ordinate logos was to him anathema; hence his small praise of Grecian things; hence his ignoring of a whole side of Italian Renaissance art. From this failing springs, barely separated from it, the second: abstract form was scarcely understood even dimly by him. He would state that French scenery was superior to English, but then he hastened to add that Swiss landscape was as superior to French as French was to English. The appreciation of the formal qualities of French landscape had manifestly escaped him. The question of Form I will treat later in its proper place. Third, and last, I fear we must place a puritan prudery far removed from the spirit of fair Hellenic days, when the athlete’s frame was almost worshipped for the glorious balance of its detailed mass, powerful yet fraught with grace, a bright gleaming symbol of the measure of ourselves, glad vanquisher of things beside a hyacinth sea; when, too, was worshipped that conjugate meeting of extremes, a woman’s form, now flowerlike in shrinking frailty, now magnificent as lasting architecture, yet again, glad with light gaiety of youth and Artemisian liberty. No, Mr. Ruskin, you praised unstintedly the mantling tints of Turner, the glory of his evening skies, his fatalist rendering of the steadfast mystery of the Alps; you did work, even great work, in freeing the people from convention’s thraldom; you were a preacher of better things, but of better things that you yourself understood but dimly. A revolutionist, you had the faults and the qualities of your calling. Erasmus thinks; the narrower Luther evangelizes.\r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"6cacfa77-95bd-447e-812f-37c83458a384","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":51,"end":56,"value":"f74f504d-60c1-480a-85a7-2beed6df792e","text":"Ruski","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"5a4356f8-e8c2-4cda-abc7-fcd5384acbab","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":51,"end":56,"value":"f74f504d-60c1-480a-85a7-2beed6df792e","text":"Ruski","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"257ba905-ea8a-4f00-877a-2199cf47b17c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":73,"end":73,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"06fdb988-eee2-4434-ac91-d38077443fc6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":75,"end":75,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"1302c8b5-43bd-4ba8-802b-1145c9983912","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":351,"end":373,"value":"6ee4c39e-603c-4459-bb57-afba6bd99ebe","text":"Italian Renaissance ar","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"3626462a-4956-4317-b046-eb3351e1a7ca","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":769,"end":769,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"93c41f5a-2aeb-403f-b079-601a329bf282","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":771,"end":771,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"e0641487-33cf-4d01-9427-2d0bd4c4cefe","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":826,"end":826,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"6763a35d-8538-4dac-bd7e-faff4730c018","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":828,"end":828,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"4274a18d-2447-4128-a042-9e64e7193a1a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1373,"end":1382,"value":"f74f504d-60c1-480a-85a7-2beed6df792e","text":"Mr. Ruski","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"b455b02b-9732-4080-a8a3-e16b3bc35757","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1431,"end":1436,"value":"02164603-021e-4dd4-9079-5a9b383430c3","text":"Turne","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"29637a10-b860-4717-805c-31cbdf4c9286","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1431,"end":1436,"value":"02164603-021e-4dd4-9079-5a9b383430c3","text":"Turne","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"bdfe0332-f8cd-49c0-9982-6bbff6a4bdfa","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1526,"end":1529,"value":"d11afe99-13f9-4268-9257-8e7172fd62fc","text":"Alp","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"1508aaff-8a37-4747-aefd-d027528f8b32","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1528,"end":1531,"value":"d11afe99-13f9-4268-9257-8e7172fd62fc","text":"ps;","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false}],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"f4f28796-e164-47c2-8ff2-58806a8f4f3e","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"384c37bf-dc47-4dba-94e5-7340c4f99601","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"Ignorance is not an asset of art, nor is knowledge baneful to it, though pseudo-knowledge inevitably is. One of the essential conditions of artistry is: Just and ordered choice. The painter, the sculptor, who does not know how to choose the elements of his intended manifestation in a co-ordinate and balanced way fails. This is true whatever be his artistic tenets, whether he be impulsive or cerebral, romantic or classic; it is only the nature of the method of co-ordination that varies. The anatomy of Michael-Angelo was at least as masterly as that of his successors; the latter failed, not because they studied anatomy, as Ruskin would have us think, but simply because they were inferior artists; simply because they had little or nothing to express by means of their knowledge which was, itself, imperfect. Their knowledge of anatomy may have been — was, especially at Bologna — of a degree quite sufficiently great; it does not follow that their knowledge of all the othef composing factors of a work of art was equally so. In every masterpiece an unquestionable equilibrium is established between all its parts. If undue stress be laid on the anatomical components, the work will be inferior. Any great work fuses to an integral whole, and the technique (I use the word in its most extended sense) that makes its presence felt is one of low quality. I must not be understood to mean that the work must be so finished up as to render the method of painting invisible; I have equally in mind certain Leonardo perfections of ‘added fact’ and other rapid, nigh on instantaneous indications, masterly in reserve of means, fully suggestive by reason of faultless choice oj the essential. There lies the difference between the clever running of a water-colour wash, in order to make a vain show of technical address, and the sure noting of a great man dominated, obsessed by the need of transcribing some chance movement of a model, some strange glint of sunlight on a distant sea, some arabesque of his own thought’s imagining. Ruskin told us that finish was added fact; in this he was right.(1) The pity is that he remained content with his aphorism, and sought no further the real meaning of his words. Is anatomy an illusion? He might well have put the question to himself; but he did not. Had he done so, and done similarly on every like occasion, the instructive value of his teaching would have been far greater. Ruskin might have said that when artists began to investigate anatomy, they began to render their own task far more difficult of execution. In this there may be some truth; though it rather tacitly implies that it is easier to be a Giotto than to be a Michael-Angelo; a proposition that I am inclined to reject. What is unquestionably correct is that it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the suggestive and aesthetic value of a work when we increase the number of expressive factors, and thus augment the chances of committing error. On the other hand, the increasing difficulty of execution is to some degree balanced by the increasing difficulty of criticism; the critic becomes slightly confused in presence of a bewildering appeal to too many separate critical efforts. In the years following on 1500 a decadence of art set in; this decadence was in no way due to the study of anatomy, but to the mental inefficiency of the artists themselves. The human body was contorted in the 'manner' of Michael-Angelo; the light and shade of Leonardo was exaggerated — if possible; the Italian school then suffered a domination of technique for technique’s sake (it will be noticed that I am including even type of pose under the heading of ‘technique’); a domination quite analogous to the nineteenth-century English abuse of technique and tidiness, in the abuse of carefully careless water-colour blots and slick brush-work, which followed on the valid work of Turner. The knowledge of Turner can hardly be arraigned as responsible for the inefficiency of those who came after him! If, then, I am favourable to the study of anatomy, why am I discontented with the anatomists? A short while back I stated that aesthetic transmission of idea was largely based on choice of the essential (and, of course, on proper coordination of that choice; which is really the same thing). This is equivalent to saying that we must judge the relative values of the different elements which we employ in our work; in other words, we must use them in order. It is this aesthetic order of importance that is so little realized by the greater number of writers on so-called artistic anatomy. The use of a muscle is stated; its shape is roughly described, as is the mode of its attachment; but no means is given to the unhappy student of exactly estimating its artistic importance. The omo-hyoid muscle, the presence of which it is exceedingly difficult to detect, and which may be looked on from the painter’s or the sculptor’s point of view as literally nonexistent, is described by Marshall with almost the same care as the important mass of the gastrocnemius. Then again the diagrams are the work of undistinguished draughtsmen, who have no care for the real and solid conformation of a bone or muscle, which it is, of course, paramount for an artist to have and hold in mind as a concrete and perfected idea. The anatomical drawings of Leonardo, of Michael-Angelo meet this need; why are they not employed to illustrate artistic anatomies? Why is an ‘art student’ supposed to learn art from teaching and diagrams from which every trace of art is carefully expurgated, and replaced by tidiness, flatness, and time-tables?\r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"3339c1e4-2cd5-40b9-b3c9-262e1811008e","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":506,"end":519,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","text":"Michael-Angel","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"f057bb95-d2e2-4c4c-a1a8-86288c9c2ee7","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":629,"end":634,"value":"f74f504d-60c1-480a-85a7-2beed6df792e","text":"Ruski","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"57c6d73f-5cd1-4d60-af10-5854b71f6731","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":877,"end":883,"value":"c8102ebc-3fb5-4919-975a-c0db203bcf85","text":"Bologn","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"3d5670dd-d672-4e64-9b5a-9510d12626eb","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":877,"end":883,"value":"c8102ebc-3fb5-4919-975a-c0db203bcf85","text":"Bologn","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"75c136ed-9dca-4786-8489-0349935fe863","type":"page","start":949,"end":2714,"value":"4","text":"their knowledge of all the othef composing factors of a work of art was equally so.

Eccentric accentuation of the hideous has been the device of recent art; and in ways that we have never seen before, unless it be in some of the more degraded manifestations of savage output. To cut a definite section through history, to say here begins a certain development, there just beyond lies its cause, is idle. Cause and effect pass by indefinite gradations one into the other. A clear marking of commencement can be but an illusion. Nevertheless in this, as in other matters, approximation may serve a practical end. Though arguments may readily be produced in opposition to the statement, we shall not be far wrong in saying that the cult of ugliness dates from the work of Cézanne. But let us be very wary of attributing to him any such credo as those multiple beliefs professed by his pseudo-imitators. To certain, to many sides of the world’s beauty Cézanne was profoundly alive; and to him it was a source of unceasing sorrow that his lack of deftness, his insufficient knowledge, kept him from transcribing to the full such beauty in his work. Cézanne may almost be likened to some uncouth artistic seer to whom came passing visions of fair form rounded by unmeaning night. He would have been himself the first to condemn much, if not all, of the aesthetic chaos that has succeeded to his time. His selfstyled followers have chosen the easier task of imitating his defects; they have neglected, in almost every case, to reproduce his qualities.\r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"7fec9161-a7fd-48e0-a621-245d223c89b2","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":829,"end":835,"value":"d4f61538-6c2f-4625-aa2d-e47ff64ff768","text":"Cézann","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"6c6bd1fd-9230-4bfd-8064-c0267683dc63","type":"style/italics","start":893,"end":897,"value":"","text":"cred","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"ed2a35e4-590b-4491-8204-ca86c849e2f1","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1008,"end":1014,"value":"d4f61538-6c2f-4625-aa2d-e47ff64ff768","text":"Cézann","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"10789045-5e7b-4f77-ad43-f039815708d0","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1204,"end":1210,"value":"d4f61538-6c2f-4625-aa2d-e47ff64ff768","text":"Cézann","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false}],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"4f943d89-738e-4d96-a094-aab2d426600b","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"e31e4248-9b60-4bb1-ad17-0a433bab21d7","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"A spirit of dislocation, a pseudo-scientific pretence at analysis has crept during the last three decades into the realm of art; faulty ratiocination has ofttimes replaced subconscious aesthetic judgement, for the most part unhappily absent. To what extent should I take count, in a work such as this, of the doings of a whole period of artistic history? The answer remains to a very great degree a matter of personal opinion. After consideration, after taking into account that the present movement (and that of the immediate past) in art has not yet shown us its definite crystallization, I have decided not to treat in this volume of the more unusual theories concerning the use of form. I myself have assisted at the birth of the many latter-day aesthetic conventions; I have myself been profoundly influenced by them. It will for the moment be enough to allow this influence to mould subconsciously the making of my thought. What I shall write could scarcely have been written thirty years ago. The ineffaceable thought-tendency is there, be it or be it not openly manifest in a chapter bearing some such title as ‘Drawing in Modern Art’. Years ago Eugène Carrière said to us, his class: ‘I do not wish you to paint as I do. I am here to point out certain facts in the construction of the figure which I must find rendered in your work; facts which I have always found rendered in valid work of all periods. How you render them is your own affair.’ Can I do better than follow his eclecticism? Some of my readers may complain that I have not fulfilled the promise of my title-page when they fail to find indexed a chapter on the ‘Art and Craft of (say) Cubistic Drawing Let them bear with me; my subject is already large; this volume would become unwieldy were I to crowd within its covers every possibility of this kind. I will limit myself to an incomplete statement of what my own artistic experience has taught me to be the essentials of the craft, whatever may be the particular workshop, in which we elect to work, whatever may be the trademark we write above the door. I will leave largely aside the tendencies which as yet are uncrystallized; I will restrict myself almost entirely in the matter of examples to past and firmly established work; and if dissident voices reach me, I will content myself with asking: ‘Have you noticed how curiously modern Claude Lorrain’s drawings appear to us, or how little out of date certain fragments of archaic Greek statuary seem to be?’\r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"0d960ae4-24cd-4f16-ae87-dbdf65e41290","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":264,"end":264,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"02a2e3e3-edba-46d3-a128-d393def9f572","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":266,"end":266,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"e5893e3c-14f7-403d-9681-9d0eb0bed056","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":591,"end":591,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"5d9b7f4b-184a-4d3c-8486-eb46347e601c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":593,"end":593,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"af63d380-19ea-49d6-bbbd-cbdc1475ecfa","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":691,"end":691,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"ea9b17a6-00f3-44bc-9e9c-1621e9f665d1","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":693,"end":698,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"mysel","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"b157b953-3c53-438c-a1c7-1064e9e76bf5","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":693,"end":693,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"552a8468-8f4e-4e2b-8105-dab8d1c82451","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":773,"end":773,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"3b66d605-1217-4312-8270-e8fbc12a8601","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":775,"end":775,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"969e0709-96f6-4d04-8755-17a52e1bef7a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":780,"end":785,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"mysel","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"adcc4159-76d4-4c8f-9fa2-6b76dee5be47","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":918,"end":919,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"m","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"b043658a-bab2-40df-91bb-5740751f0930","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":935,"end":935,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"7eaea4da-63c6-421d-b1a2-ffb388521a1a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":937,"end":937,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"0bd05199-7ab1-4903-b9bd-bd3d8c05c5b4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1154,"end":1168,"value":"307bf4a3-49ea-465d-8271-a67eae2e7d94","text":"Eugène

Yet the thought of Cézanne is really evident enough.\r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"2aaf1641-e78e-4d6d-996a-e3f0703dee3f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":126,"end":132,"value":"d4f61538-6c2f-4625-aa2d-e47ff64ff768","text":"Cézann","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"d63e2132-f175-47aa-845c-3a879e6fcc08","type":"style/italics","start":151,"end":245,"value":"","text":"Ces musées! les tableaux des musées! nous ne voyons plus la nature, nous revoyons des tableaux","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"7820aca5-f3f9-4bcf-a09a-399e142a90a8","type":"language","start":151,"end":245,"value":"fr","text":"Ces musées! les tableaux des musées! nous ne voyons plus la nature, nous revoyons des tableaux","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"ada67af0-ecb1-4606-a5a9-36489d947360","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":637,"end":642,"value":"57c8cf34-730c-4b0f-8595-d950da982dba","text":"Louvr","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"d8a0020a-629a-4733-b3a1-ba9f657e62d2","type":"language","start":680,"end":694,"value":"fr","text":"anciens régime","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"90f07e04-6fd9-485d-ba86-776baa89289a","type":"style/italics","start":680,"end":694,"value":"","text":"anciens régime","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"d4a9bb71-b4a5-41e2-a87c-ed1f43edf88d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":716,"end":722,"value":"d4f61538-6c2f-4625-aa2d-e47ff64ff768","text":"Cézann","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false}],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"50e17af6-b0c8-446d-88b8-34e6b0319277","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"1390493a-7a16-4756-a6f4-351817f065fb","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"In striking contrast with the vaguely formulated aesthetic tenets of Europe there exists on another portion of the globe a marvellously co-ordinated system of plastic laws, of laws considered inviolable even to-day, although they count some fifteen hundred years of existence; perhaps it is because they count so great a period of time since their inception, that they are no longer, indeed they never were, a matter of opinion; they are an essentialized result of the aesthetic convictions, not of a person, but of a whole race to whom art was from the beginning an inherent part of life. Is it needful to say that I speak of the two great nations of the Farther East, of China, and of Japan who borrowed from the former the bases of her artistic credo? Two reasons lead me to develop somewhat at length the position that the Extreme Orient takes up with regard to the plastic arts. The first of these reasons is the more evident one; it is that I fail to see in what way the general formulae of the Chinese or Japanese aesthetic can be refuted. The second reason is a more subtle one. I would call in the aid of a discussion of this aesthetic — in so many ways so different in its completeness from our own unordered attempts — to create an atmosphere which I would fain conjure up so that it may, in a subtle way, permeate all subsequent explanations that I hope to make. For the moment I must be content with calling attention to the profound significance of this Far Eastern art, to its keen sense of the insoluble junctions that exist between the rhythmic sweep of a brush stroke and the ultimate problems of the universe. Such a view of art, it is hardly an exaggeration to say, is wholly unknown in Europe. I may here be accused of quitting the ground of practical drawing instruction to enter on that of metaphysical speculation. If I be so accused, I must remind my reader that the title of this book is: ‘The Art and Craft of Drawing’; now by Art I mean Art as distinct from Craft; otherwise my title would contain a redundancy. Art is essentially an abstract thing; were my aim simply to propound recipes for the production of colourable imitations of the human or other forms by means of lead pencil or other media, all abstract discussion would assuredly be beside the mark. But such is not my aim ; indeed I would rather take up arms in the very contrary cause; I would try in. part to suppress the already too great mass of drab and meaningless monotony of tidy work turned out by the too numerous Art (?) Schools of England. Now what concrete differences can we trace between the drawing of a great master and that possibly more correct one by some prize student whom a ruthless fate will subsequently condemn to oblivion ? We are obliged to fall back on abstractions before we can determine the very evident difference of artistic value that exists between the two. This book is only addressed to those who will accept the postulated position that a mental attitude is at the basis of all artistic production of worth; that though one side of art be craft yet the other and greater element of it, that which inspires the craft itself, is intellectual, intangible, spiritual. What better way can I find of creating here and now this atmosphere of transcendent things than by shortly expounding the secular Chinese doctrine of the Tao? How shall I put it better forth than by translating into English the short and wonderfully able condensation that M. Chavannes has given of it?\r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"f02373ee-4fb6-49d5-80e7-b7f722b34364","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":616,"end":616,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"b3fd5614-70c0-4b9b-840c-89fecd486bb0","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":618,"end":618,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"8b06c63c-6ebb-4e39-b988-a300a1f867dd","type":"style/italics","start":748,"end":752,"value":"","text":"cred","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"d44aa634-fbf5-4e9b-b08d-b162d957052f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":947,"end":947,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"576b79d4-0b50-4a86-bbf2-ddf9f3b8e484","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":949,"end":949,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"4b3f7f87-5895-49af-ad63-a27e4df090c1","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1087,"end":1087,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"ad7fa0a4-c39d-479d-bbef-0d77652cbb3c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1089,"end":1089,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"ced0e54d-8156-4947-98f0-a838d96578ba","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1260,"end":1260,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"f02a120d-54f3-4f55-8152-7b73e5944fb9","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1262,"end":1262,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"e71e3ca0-2c24-4664-a8ab-c76571d29678","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1359,"end":1359,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"caed4999-a588-45fe-ab59-1e669f2732a0","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1361,"end":1361,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"c034b679-3baf-40e5-a598-944b51f2c6a0","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1390,"end":1390,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"5ce80a9a-b5d0-478e-9e67-a4dba0c41d8b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1392,"end":1392,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"bd712605-d67c-4d60-9012-9e610eeb9583","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1715,"end":1715,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"f51c22a7-320a-4193-ae25-4c76be2a9499","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1717,"end":1717,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"0bf9db4f-76bf-426e-9fe1-e4000bf40067","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1842,"end":1842,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"8a598587-46ea-4743-9309-9568dc44964e","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1844,"end":1844,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"9fd98a84-ee79-4290-8ce9-f7cd29f5d359","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1859,"end":1859,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"b97a3ea2-d953-4d34-9c7f-0f158f5e4a49","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1861,"end":1861,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"2bcf8b6b-0ae5-4d26-9e14-4b7497e174ce","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1873,"end":1874,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"m","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"9fc6a3f0-b9c1-4e46-960b-fa068e67ff01","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1958,"end":1958,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"d4bc8748-98cb-4f0d-a419-ce27f7425f1f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1960,"end":1960,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"4c95475a-603c-496f-b40b-0b3e2f2e8583","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":2003,"end":2004,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"m","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"ba3c2d03-ce18-45ae-a71e-765a3df396f1","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":2083,"end":2084,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"m","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"6752c4de-40c0-40f1-8d94-ad9a6f606246","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":2305,"end":230

European intellect but little used to the modes of thought of the Extreme East hesitates to transpose into our languages, designed for the expression of other thoughts, the concise and energetic formulae in which this antique philosophy finds expression. ... A unique principle reigns over and is realized in the world in relation to which it is at the same time transcendent and immanent. This principle is that which has neither form nor colour, nor has it sound; it is that which exists before all things, that which is unnameable yet it is that which appears among ephemeral beings, constraining them to follow a type, impressing upon them a reflection of the supreme reason. Here and there in Nature we perceive the luminous flashes by which the presence of this principle is made manifest to the wise, and we conceive some vague idea of its consummate majesty. But once these rare heights are attained, the spirit worships silently, well knowing that human words are incapable of expressing this entity that encloses within itself the universe and more than the universe. To symbolize this principle, at least in some degree, we apply to it a term, which if it do not indicate the unfathomable essence of this mystery, does to some extent express the manner in which it makes itself known to us ; we call the principle: The Way; The Tao. The Way ... the word first implies the idea of Power in Movement, of Action; the final principle is not a motionless term, of which the dead perfection will, at most, satisfy the needs of pure reason; it is the life of a ceaseless becoming, at the same time relative, because it is changing, and absolute, because it is eternal. The Way ... again the word suggests the idea of the fixed and certain direction, of which all stages succeed to one another in determined order; the universal ‘becoming’ is not a vain agitation; it is the realization of a law of harmony.’ Without understanding this vast naturalism by which is governed the splendid hierarchy of Heaven, of Earth, of Mankind, we cannot hope to penetrate to the significance of the Six Laws of Painting formulated by Sie Ho, critic and painter in late fifth-century China. These Laws have governed Chinese painting from then till now. Of a surety they are worthy of some consideration. They are expressed with that extreme and almost cryptic conciseness in which the Chinese language delights; hence their transference to an occidental tongue is far from easy.\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"da99b858-d293-4d52-b739-3fe2bff4377c","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"13717489-1479-458a-a163-d3572f5095af","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"1st.

The Spirit’s consonance or rhythm constitutes the creative element of movement of life. The unstaying flow is naught but a tangible manifestation of this rhythm which permeates all immensity. Harmonious motion of the spirit engenders the perpetual flow of things; they are the consequence themselves of its action; they would disappear into nothingness were the flow to stop. The artist should, it follows, perceive, before all things, and over and across the movement of shapes, the rhythm of the spirit, the cosmic ^principle they express; beyond appearances he should seize upon the Universal. When Mr. Hatton writes about drawing, he gives us excellent but incomplete advice; he tells us: ‘The drawing must be made in as long lines as possible, there must be no patching together of little bits.’ This contains only a small part of the truth. In reality it is not the length of the drawn line that is important, it is the rhythm of it that Sie Ho would insist on as being a counterpart of the rhythm of the Tao. A ‘patched’ line will assuredly be void of rhythm; on the other hand it is not because we determine to draw a long line that that line must necessarily be instinct with rhythmic life. Before we can hope to reproduce such rhythm we must, so to say, intoxicate ourselves both with the abstract conception of universal harmony and with the particular manifestation of it that we have at the moment before our eyes. Then, and then only, can we hope to create on our paper some distant, not replica of the universal harmony, but vague foreshadowing of its ever unattainable perfection. A few days ago I tried to draw in a London Art School. After a short time I got up and went out, too horribly oppressed by the nullity of my surroundings. No spark of aesthetic intelligence illuminated the thirty faces that surrounded me. Their owners were there because it had occurred to them to ‘take up art’. Right and left of me, pseudo-industry displayed itself by temporary sketching in some half-inch of weak line, as a trial, as an attempt to find if it would ‘do’. It generally disappeared more swiftly than it came, erased by a most necessary piece of india-rubber. No kind of application was evident; a sad uniformity of unintelligent action pervaded the room. In vain one sought some sign of that strained sympathy with the essentials of the harmonious balance of the model’s forms; some sign of that consonance of spirit’ that ‘engenders the movement of life’; and truly the drawings about me were dead, lifeless enough. What was a discussion concerning universal rhythm to such a crowd of nonentities? What, in consequence, was the value of their drawings? Neither a long line nor a short line will influence the value of your work.

The law is (it is well to repeat): The law of bones by means of the brush. This figurative language of the East demands some explanation. In these occult terms Sie Ho means to call attention to the necessity for the painter, once he has seized the real nature of the elements of the world, to penetrate to the secret folds and centres of things and beings where the Tao lies hidden. The expression, by means of the brush, of this secret governing of things becomes confounded with the demonstration of the internal construction. In this way the artist evokes the feeling of the tangible object. His task is to define the essential structure which gives to things their transitory individuality wherein the eternal principle is reflected. It is only after he has discovered the profound meaning of appearances; after he has found that it lies in the junction between the rhythm of the spirit with the movement of life; it is only after he has conquered the possibility of expression by holding and conceiving the essentials of internal structure, that he can hope to reproduce form in its conformity with the beings of the earth. Here we are in contact with an excessively ancient Chinese notion, that of Saintliness in man. The Saint in China is one who is possessed of perfect conformity with his own nature or — what comes to the same — with the universal principle and order which is in him. By this very conformity the Holy Man becomes the equal of Heaven and of Earth; by a similar conformity the painted semblance takes on more than the value of a simple representation; it becomes a veritable creation realized in the principle, itself, of the Tao. This is evident when we remember that as each being or each object represented in the work of art is, according to our supposition, in complete conformity with its own inherent nature, the work of art becomes automatically the image of a perfect world wherein the essential principles balance one another in harmonious proportion. But the strict application of the spirit of the second and third laws of Sie Ho must inevitably lead the painter to the study of the essentials of the form; hence to an astonishing synthesis of them, which indeed we  find never to be lacking in the masterpieces of the Far East.\r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"2076a408-48cd-4ea7-8997-d06eed69aecc","type":"style/italics","start":126,"end":163,"value":"","text":"The law of bones by means of the brus","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"9d04775d-134c-44ac-b6ff-52e31e0ba8cb","type":"style/italics","start":1167,"end":1217,"value":"","text":"form in its conformity with the beings of the eart","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false}],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"4c09d5a3-a5e6-4a88-afb9-75a811a020cb","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"5f0ab673-56ad-4a84-848c-c41558c70209","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"The fourth law now appears as an almost logical consequence of the preceding ones. Distribute colour according to the similitude of objects. The essence of structure being disclosed, perfect form being defined, it remains to clothe these essentials with the living and evanescent mantle of tint; and this tint should be meted out in accord with the likeness of the beings and of the objects. Being in accord with them, colour also must evoke, by choice and measure, the fundamental elements of all. It may appear curious that it is now, and now only, that the Chinese aesthete begins to consider the ‘ensemble’ the composition as we might insufficiently say, for I think here is contained more than we are usually inclined to include within the signification of the term. True, the text of the fifth law runs: Arrange the lines and attribute to them their hierarchic places. In other words the artist is enjoined to carry out in the arrangement of the lines, masses, and other pictorial elements through the space where he is at work, the same suggestion of immanent natural harmony which he has learnt to be omnipresent. Between the shape of the surface and the distribution of the pictorial elements the harmonious principle of the universe finds renewed expression. When the Tao is thus realized throughout the entire work the artist has of a truth created; and legends similar to that of Pygmalion are not lacking; legends that tell of the dragon or genie coming to sudden life beneath the master’s brush and quitting silk or paper to disappear in swirling clouds.(1) By thus creating forms which contain within them the essence itself of the universe the picture becomes a real propagation of forms (6th Law); the difference between the natural and the humanly created form disappears, for in each case the form becomes, as it were, no more than the external vesture of one and the same thing, the essential principle, the Tao. Thus there is complete welding, complete homogeneity between natural and artistic creation. There is no longer an aesthetic; the aesthetic is the same thing as, is identical with, general philosophy, which itself is indistinguishable from the whole phenomenal universe, so interwoven together are the comprehending and perceptive values.\r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"3b454a32-5836-4ba9-9ce2-0ec7691c8b13","type":"style/italics","start":83,"end":138,"value":"","text":"Distribute colour according to the similitude of object","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"9bc05d86-336d-492a-b3c3-c863d8d5ad2b","type":"language","start":601,"end":608,"value":"fr","text":"ensembl","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"c69f1b28-d096-46ea-bd3a-e5e58b4dcaf2","type":"style/italics","start":601,"end":608,"value":"","text":"ensembl","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"8eb6b101-8b4f-4dd8-9bb6-b53937e0471c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":663,"end":663,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"9267a0de-a799-4176-8b11-a395a9e9ed5e","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":665,"end":665,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"c890bee6-bdf7-4cf8-ae53-d0ef60bdb697","type":"style/italics","start":810,"end":872,"value":"","text":"Arrange the lines and attribute to them their hierarchic place","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false}],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"a3c9c21f-1d43-4672-a8a0-9a5f9d4d7e5d","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"c7fd6e0a-70b3-4d49-8b02-fbd7b9d7a9d2","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"During the history of the world two completed artistic systems have been constructed, and two only.

As a rule they have remained stylises and decorative, none of them has developed a naturalist school and, as an almost inevitable concomitant of it, a school of landscape art.

The representation of ourselves would seem to be a sine qua non of dominating art. The Celtic, the Germanic, races were unable to produce a figure art without the fecundating influence of Greece, though in our comparative ignorance of Greek origins it would be safer to say that the northern parts of Europe never produced adequate figure presentation till they inherited the Mediterranean and Greek tradition. Celt and Scandinavian were skilful in pattern-weaving, but in the art of representing objects they remained negligible. Indeed it would seem necessary to institute rather a sharp boundary between drawing as an art of representation, and the conception and execution of decorative design(1); after all, it obviously requires less subtle observation to produce fairly well-balanced geometrical inventions than it does to follow, with a view to subsequent reproduction, the intricate rhythms and equilibria of living forms. Egypt and Assyria were too special in their arts to leave lineal descendants. Their arts, intimately attached to their religions, could hardly persist when the beliefs were dead. Tens of centuries had frozen Egyptian Art to a hieratic formula fitted to the valley of the Nile, and when it at last expired it passed utterly away, for no living truths remained to be handed on as a heritage to future generations, to future peoples. Here and there in the history of Egyptian Art come outbreaks of naturalistic tendency; such had to be the case in order to conserve the wonderful verity of the wilful schematization, but such outbreaks would seem to have been almost intentionally suppressed, and in the thousands of years of its exercise this art scarcely deviated from its strict and decorative path. The annexed reproduction (Fig. i) may almost be taken as an example of extreme Egyptian naturalism, at least in definite work; though the plaster head (Fig. 2) is still more natural. It is, however, one of a few isolated fragments; perhaps it was only destined to play the part of a preliminary study to a work in which the variety of nature was to be severely suppressed anew.\r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"6ccd6bc1-3bcd-4507-a7df-65648deea837","type":"language","start":183,"end":194,"value":"la","text":"sine qua no","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"e80bc178-cc38-48c4-b26a-b38bf8e9ff51","type":"style/italics","start":183,"end":194,"value":"","text":"sine qua no","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"92e268dc-ff5f-414b-b216-32966bd3a239","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":320,"end":325,"value":"a5f3c8fb-1b61-4f89-a9d6-18db5dd168db","text":"Greec","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"01a44851-ebe5-4c68-9fad-452e657be560","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":322,"end":327,"value":"a5f3c8fb-1b61-4f89-a9d6-18db5dd168db","text":"eece,","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false}],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"f2c0fadc-90e4-4094-81e2-4fe971a1fed8","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"591df7e0-9602-4648-b3fc-1d96c630186b","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"At this point it will perhaps be tedious to discuss in general terms the exact ideals of various arts that will be examined during the course of this work.

Greek Art, like the Greek religion, may be termed non-metaphysical. It is the offspring of a people intensely, instinctively alive to the outward balance and beauty of things, of which they readily found an agile transcript unhesitating in its reduction of mystery to the measure of man. Abstractions were rare till Platonic times; the theogony, to the human scale, was readily presented in the human image, and formed almost the total sum of the artistic subjects. Such a clear-cut outlook was favourable to the development of a perfected plastic art fundamentally simplified in kind; and, indeed, the rise of Greek Art was extremely rapid. On the over-intense simplicity of this stem was grafted the complexity first of Christian, then of scientific thought, with the result that to-day we have no definite aesthetic orientation. Irresistibly the Greek basis of our civilization claims belief in its ideals; but to these ideals the complexity of modern thought was unknown, for it there is no place in them. European Art may almost be termed, at least in its higher efforts, one long hesitation between Hellenism and Mysticism. But Europe is essentially inartistic, especially its northern races, who, as we have seen, when left to themselves, produced naught but meaningless design. When later they learnt to reproduce the aspect of things animate and inanimate, reproduction of outward semblance, or at most of emotion, became almost their single aim. It has been reserved for quite recent times to feel vaguely the need of other and deeper artistic intent, and to grope, in a blind and disorganized way, for some few of those foundations of art that were catalogued two thousand years ago in China. What will be the outcome of this new selfconsciousness of European Art? it is impossible to say. Will the Hellenic tradition amalgamate with an aesthetic which has a transcendental origin, amalgamate to complete homogeneity? I fear that it will be many a day before such an end is fulfilled.\r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"4141b0d5-47a1-48ee-bf0b-2ccb4e607e8a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":10,"end":18,"value":"8dad1d21-f257-4368-9374-3ef03194af70","text":"Greek Ar","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"557a61a6-5ac6-494d-a155-729e361eac30","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":12,"end":20,"value":"8dad1d21-f257-4368-9374-3ef03194af70","text":"eek Art ","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"54ccb267-2dc4-4e56-b658-8cbcc458365e","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":106,"end":110,"value":"56dfc3bd-4891-4f08-97aa-423b957d0de5","text":"Chin","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"c4eabdc1-2377-4af6-bcbd-d4f4298e3c60","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":108,"end":112,"value":"56dfc3bd-4891-4f08-97aa-423b957d0de5","text":"ina ","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"c541f748-fdf1-483b-a49e-6f9d9af3072f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":215,"end":223,"value":"8dad1d21-f257-4368-9374-3ef03194af70","text":"Greek Ar","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"b4e177ed-9a77-4d0c-b9e2-c57e1a19f228","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":217,"end":225,"value":"8dad1d21-f257-4368-9374-3ef03194af70","text":"eek Art,","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"802ae429-dc06-4401-bbab-bf3aaa049bbc","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":826,"end":834,"value":"8dad1d21-f257-4368-9374-3ef03194af70","text":"Greek Ar","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"71e17a1a-4123-4fb3-aeae-27533b550dbe","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":828,"end":836,"value":"8dad1d21-f257-4368-9374-3ef03194af70","text":"eek Art ","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"d9166ce4-f058-408d-8def-6e02b41cd924","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1349,"end":1354,"value":"7cfb9816-7b48-449b-b815-97a95bcb8f79","text":"Europ","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"7051e4b3-f3f5-4fc0-b7dd-f1cf6dbfbd00","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1351,"end":1356,"value":"7cfb9816-7b48-449b-b815-97a95bcb8f79","text":"rope ","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"c4d215c0-4e72-40ad-bb7c-f28e4ec8af98","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":2144,"end":2144,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"7c067f62-0f63-4e08-ab4e-753bba5bb83f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":2146,"end":2146,"value":"0bd8f5b5-62aa-469c-9f95-7aa334eb2085","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false}],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"f0b86299-8a72-4140-91d0-aed44ea5b911","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"b4f4e7b2-a9ce-44c2-8a0c-59e1bc1c76f1","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"Now that this unquiet state is realized, now that an intense interest is taken by many in the ideals of the Far East, it becomes increasingly difficult to write such a book as this, much more difficult than it would have been fifty or more years ago.
