Their evil tower is joined to Terra Cognita, to the lands we know, by a bridge.

And the only use that is known for their ridiculous wealth is to attract to their larder a continual supply of food. In times of famine they have even been known to scatter rubies abroad, a little trail of them to some city of Man, and sure enough their larders would soon be full again.\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[{"id":"5ce04780-8e03-4e53-bc0b-d93d8df0b2d8","type":"block/alignment","value":"justify","metadata":{},"isDeleted":false}],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"2e03746b-3afd-4fc1-a065-68acea53f49a","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[{"id":"6d4ef9d0-e136-4008-a256-a3391bd14dcc","type":"block/alignment","value":"justify","metadata":{},"isDeleted":false}],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"1337098a-1a08-43c3-85b6-e528562f781e","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[{"id":"27388e99-6b5f-4319-bf47-34dcb5cb9ef0","type":"block/alignment","value":"justify","metadata":{},"isDeleted":false}],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"5bf552f5-8185-4ade-af2b-1268a7c55704","type":"image-block","metadata":{"url":"https://ruinousreliquary.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/8f37e5fe321948620f4a73ee390d2c04.jpg"},"blockProperties":[],"children":[]}]}]}]}
