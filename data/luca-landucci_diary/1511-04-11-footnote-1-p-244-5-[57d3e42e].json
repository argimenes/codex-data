The reasons which caused the Republican Government to make these decrees are worth mentioning, and are summed up in the following preface to the decree: \u0022The most exalted and magnificent Signori considering what disorder is caused in our city, and what inconvenience and injury to individual citizens and to their unmarried daughters, by the reprehensible habit, introduced here not long since, of giving large and excessive dowries, from which it has resulted that many citizens of old and noble families, not being able to give such dowries, have been forced to make alliances with persons of a rank and condition very dissimilar to their own; and also, on the other hand, that many worthy young men, through their desire of a large dowry, have taken the daughters of men who are wealthy but of a class and rank far inferior to their own; and desiring to return to the wise and good custom of the citizens of former days, and to enable girls to marry more easily; having held a long and careful colloquy on this subject, and taken the opinion of their honourable Collegi and of a number of other wise and prudent citizens, deem it to be well to make the following decree.\u0022
