The Pope sent us a Jubilee or Plenary Indulgence, and it began this day. An altar was made in the Piazza de\u0027 Signori at the foot of the steps of the Loggia, and another in Santa Maria del Fiore, offerings being presented at both of them; and there was a great procession to visit the said altars. And this indulgence had such authority that it covered everything, including matters of restitution and to do with churches, applying to those who had them by simony, etc.; also if anyone made an offering for the dead, it counted as a votive-offering.
