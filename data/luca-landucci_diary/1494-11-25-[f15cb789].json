They took the citizens\u0027 arms from them, and robbed anyone whom they encountered at night; so that some of those bold Florentines who had had the idea of slaying the French when they met them at night, were themselves slain or wounded. If the French had stayed longer they (these rash Florentines) would have gone the right way to work to bring about trouble. It is always the case that certain thoughtless men endanger cities, not considering what it means to kindle the spark; it may happen that a man of no account arouses the anger of a king by some piece of folly, without the city being to blame.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"706e16da-9a92-4604-9080-5d4ec0f734a2","type":"page","start":0,"end":701,"value":"71","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"d24f5851-a096-41db-a88d-2e64c4ab99e2","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":38,"end":43,"value":"f5a3b20f-2d1f-43ce-a26a-d66aaa7812de","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"ef86298a-957d-4f4d-8a63-1f6d607b4daf","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":207,"end":228,"value":"c6a77601-a700-4151-ad5c-43233d91bcdf","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"1b43f3f8-d1d8-4f51-ba56-3467898a8fb6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":266,"end":271,"value":"f5a3b20f-2d1f-43ce-a26a-d66aaa7812de","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"5b16521e-00d3-47cb-bb49-7d472c31203c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":343,"end":348,"value":"f5a3b20f-2d1f-43ce-a26a-d66aaa7812de","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"af3d36b1-a99e-4388-b5cc-8b715ca1dd60","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":374,"end":395,"value":"c6a77601-a700-4151-ad5c-43233d91bcdf","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[{"id":"706e16da-9a92-4604-9080-5d4ec0f734a2","type":"page","value":"71","metadata":[]}]}]}
