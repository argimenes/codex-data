It was of great reputation, and it was an honour to the city to have such a beautiful residence. When an embassy came to visit the Signoria, its members were lost in admiration at what they saw on their entrance into such a magnificent place and into the presence of such an impressive council of citizens. But may all be to the praise and glory of God, and done according to His will.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"2eb6434f-3021-4ee1-b571-7fa9fa930449","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":68,"end":71,"value":"9e232c3a-cd05-416c-bc59-9b518613f5e9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"2c6579f5-1fbd-4121-9723-b0e6cc6b58d3","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":80,"end":92,"value":"3ac9e8d1-bfa1-4372-9880-fcfcef4e5a4c","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"04718794-b2e9-4911-8da8-219b75294cba","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":108,"end":115,"value":"e1204682-3ad7-4a97-9429-203d96f5619a","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"b568d2a4-b068-49bc-9eac-467447fc5e64","type":"hyphen","start":112,"end":112,"value":null,"zeroPoint":true,"metadata":[]},{"id":"5d364192-f6ba-4d0f-89ca-f4f2b29b06ed","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":297,"end":300,"value":"9e232c3a-cd05-416c-bc59-9b518613f5e9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"396fb5d8-a080-454e-97de-ada440a52142","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":337,"end":344,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"30f02713-3ae5-487e-96ea-4d4a56254f83","type":"page","start":402,"end":820,"value":"265","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f0908b04-fd97-49a8-8d44-1a0dd45d20d5","type":"codex/trait-reference","start":402,"end":410,"value":"3f110db3-80a4-4520-9c7c-b59cdcf8dc5b","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"152b8016-0b1f-4b76-8214-1d57fbb924f1","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":412,"end":419,"value":"e1204682-3ad7-4a97-9429-203d96f5619a","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"2050df2a-0ad6-44ab-a369-e3d195c0c1fd","type":"codex/trait-reference","start":412,"end":419,"value":"30f2a5a1-722f-4c3c-b22d-81fa24613200","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"cb5e4c0f-a979-45ac-b067-c70c78503e91","type":"hyphen","start":456,"end":456,"value":null,"zeroPoint":true,"metadata":[]},{"id":"3689cf1f-2286-40f1-8aac-9653e2a1346c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":492,"end":495,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"3d43f1d2-774e-46fe-b1d0-d7e2a2248fc6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":567,"end":574,"value":"e7e25450-c79a-4fda-ac86-f59bfa2248f1","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"1d4f2bcc-f70d-4685-89b4-2b73a6d60892","type":"style/italics","start":567,"end":574,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"9368f23d-8390-4885-8f0d-28c110e6ca45","type":"language","start":567,"end":574,"value":"it","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e2a0895a-c3e9-424b-b372-06d4d377adaf","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":785,"end":787,"value":"a3fed3ec-1814-4027-a2d5-ac598b2fcb6f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"5784eb91-a963-46c6-a30c-3b52b5b973b0","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":816,"end":819,"value":"7bd1c6f6-c2ac-4d7a-8ff5-cff7db298309","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"16b131b8-49a1-4e60-a35c-4d1fa341402f","type":"codex/document-reference","start":821,"end":821,"value":"6115451c-c69d-4f00-8980-83e272d89be6","zeroPoint":true,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[]}]}
