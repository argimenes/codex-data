We heard that the papal and Spanish armies were defeated by the French, and 10 thousand men slain,\u00A0two-thirds Spanish and one-third French. About 22 French lords were killed, and amongst them a nephew of the king, who many said had been our enemy: but perhaps it was not so. And it was said that if the French had not used so much artillery, which destroyed many hundreds of men-at-arms and cavalry, they would have been worsted. This was on the 11th April, the day of the Pasqua di Resurresso (Easter Day), near Ravenna, where the level had been made; and they had shattered one another in such a way, that although the French were victorious, nevertheless both armies were dispersed, and could do no harm to Florence, and the Spaniards might be thankful that they could go away without being plundered. Those who went through Romagna were plundered and even slain; but none of those who came through our territories had a hair of their head touched. They all went down to Rome, and the French went in the direction of Milan.

So far I have said nothing of the young girls; but, amongst other cases, there was a father who, wishing to conceal his five grown-up daughters, in his dread, made a certain cavern and put them in it, with food for several days, intending to return and bring more food; but unfortunately he was killed, and as no one else knew about it, and the girls were unable to get out, they died there. Later the cavern was discovered, and the girls all dead, having bitten each other\u0027s arms. It is impossible to describe the horrors that one was continually hearing. It was said that a certain captain of the King of France, upon entering Brescia, took the beautiful daughter of a gentleman of the city, keeping her for many days, and when her father continually sent to demand that he should give her back, he refused. Finally, he told the father that if he wanted the girl back, he must give him a thousand ducats; and the said citizen collected the sum and brought it to him; and this captain took it, and then said that he wished to keep the girl one more night. The unfortunate father, overcome by despair, said:\u00A0\u0022Signore! Since you will not give her back to me, take my life also!\u0022 and the Frenchman, being without fear of God, seized his sword from his side, and slew him. If this sin deserves punishment from the omnipotent God, who will not say that this man is bound to go to hell? May God keep us, and pardon them their great sins.
