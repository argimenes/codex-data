They were killed in consequence of a certain conspiracy made by Messer Jacopo de\u0027 Pazzi and Franceschino de\u0027 Pazzi and Guglielmo de\u0027 Pazzi, the which Guglielma was he brother-in-law of Lorenzo de\u0027 Medici, his wife being a sister of theirs, called Bianca. And the sons of Messer Piero de\u0027 Pazzi were also there, that is, Andrea and Renato and Niccolo; and of the house of Salviati, there were Francesco, Bishop of Pisa, and Jacopo Salviati, who was son-in-law to Filippo Tornabuoni, and another Jacopo also a Salviati, and Jacopo, son of Messer Poggio, Bracciolini and Bernardo Bandini of the house of Baroncegli, and Amerigo Corsi, and many others. The conspirators brought Cardinal di San Giorgio here, who was a young man; he entered Florence on the day above-mentioned, and they all came together in Santa Maria del Fiore, and, as I have said, at the elevation of the Host seized their swords, and it is said that Francesco de\u0027 Pazzi struck Giuliano, and Bandini the other. And having killed Giuliano they wanted to kill Lorenzo, but did not succeed, as he fled into the sacristy. Meantime the Bishop de\u0027 Salviati, with Jacopo, son of Messer Poggio, and two of his relatives who were both called Jacopo, went to the Palagio, with several priests, feigning to desire to speak to the Signoria, and they spoke to the Gonfaloniere, and became somewhat confused. The Gonfaloniere perceived the treachery, and he and his companions shut themslves up here and there, and ordered the doors to be closed, and the bell run for a parlamento. And what with the rumour which came from Santa Maria del Fiore of Giuliano\u0027s death and the bell ringing at the Palagio, the city was immediately in arms. And Lorenzo de\u0027 Medici was taken to his house. Meantime Messer Jacopo de\u0027 Pazzi rushed on horseback to the Piazza de\u0027 Signori, crying \u0022Popolo e liberta!\u0022 (The People and Liberty!), wishing to take the Palagio, but the bishop not having succeeded in getting possession of it, Messer Jacopo was not able to enter. He then went towards his own house, and was advised to take to flight; and he fled by the Porta all Croce, together with many men-at-arms, in the Piazza and at Lorenzo de\u0027 Medici\u0027s house. And numbers of men on the side of the conspirators were killed in the Piazza; amongst others a priest of the bishop\u0027s was killed there, his body being quartered and the head cut off, and then the head was stuck on the top of a lance, and carried about Florence the whole day, and one quarter of his body was carried on a spit all through the city, with the cry of: \u0022Death to the traitors!\u0022 That same evening the cardinal was taken to the Palagio, barely escaping with his life, all his companions being captured without exception.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"5fdb6991-2b70-4a7d-839c-c060e2e37f23","type":"codex/time-reference","start":29,"end":35,"value":"48809b12-3c56-48da-83a6-19111b052a2e","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"913a5bb1-277e-45a4-90cc-d4c24a87cde6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":38,"end":39,"value":"de7b73d6-2054-4c55-90d8-57977603cbf3","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"b2e0fdd4-2498-4664-bcf2-969a7168d286","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":41,"end":61,"value":"c40c3fba-2236-4df0-a43e-22bf23f9f6f8","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"284f5fbd-50aa-4d31-9b46-26d38e0113ed","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":142,"end":146,"value":"ecd34265-29a2-424c-b5c8-749663f155e1","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"6c4fd823-5ded-4516-bccf-7c31d0dba8a9","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":156,"end":172,"value":"c543d0e8-3393-41f3-b6bd-6da03fcd6054","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7702e825-4888-4027-8d64-637d0fa62220","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":179,"end":192,"value":"9c363d84-578c-427e-a509-8b12b3ede470","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"fca37149-f502-4faf-9202-5860a6eb1376","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":287,"end":304,"value":"e45fed44-17a0-4c2c-9c00-858667a17904","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"cca19e86-cc60-49f2-9646-1cd6cb71a988","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":435,"end":457,"value":"4a4e3340-bc95-4504-8380-c472ba3fde3c","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"fb07981b-34ed-4901-b9e7-e2d50043ac93","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":463,"end":484,"value":"fda5fb09-1859-4b1b-9540-3093d3293492","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8e3f4b2e-be5b-4dc7-b994-c86ecb129612","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":490,"end":508,"value":"91204c6c-b675-407f-b6e4-565dde452a45","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"41405b6c-12b7-41d9-bc92-3bb4086b3730","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":556,"end":573,"value":"e45fed44-17a0-4c2c-9c00-858667a17904","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"1f5ab183-7856-428d-a3eb-c70f4935ecc6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":642,"end":663,"value":"e6568a1a-b8b4-49c6-9c20-433acda89e0f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"69cf6c0f-4dd7-4fcb-98f5-0841b2e8a316","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":733,"end":737,"value":"7868018a-75e3-412b-aeed-4fa736a7b6ea","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"29eaf17d-d84e-4905-938e-8d0fbcb19740","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":742,"end":749,"value":"e836221a-9f78-4961-b501-63cada80023b","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"3adbfde9-6aa8-436f-9040-22c1cd7195a7","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":774,"end":787,"value":"58d728ca-dd77-4852-bc12-dd2d00efe5c6","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"de1abb49-9cfc-4872-ac77-c0fe211ac536","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":794,"end":808,"value":"f4627a4a-cc8b-4a06-afa5-9df44570cee4","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"5a6fec9f-7325-4715-8988-8434f05af6da","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":833,"end":850,"value":"b1b71dfe-5ccf-4f09-a406-b76f38e8b126","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"5b0e586a-7a05-48c1-a376-24ccfe7b829a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":908,"end":920,"value":"a35614da-48d4-43f6-b4dc-0479dd8506ac","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"2a284ae6-8fbe-4ae8-975d-4858b93bf896","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":923,"end":933,"value":"119d4d9d-421c-4c53-af79-30d3370f1f4e","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f82e5b2d-b12b-443b-8f65-afd58001e5db","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":939,"end":954,"value":"30de9970-6007-4aad-ba27-04e316343d6a","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"5edbb886-b9d2-4919-bd03-97aefb58fe52","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":972,"end":981,"value":"94e64183-85ef-422e-987e-debbf044c5d9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"002a495f-72d0-4364-af1c-6aeb97c1c492","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":988,"end":1000,"value":"92af8682-89f5-4781-9911-4ff6619ef275","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"03e9070d-dee2-4cba-9947-a5486e9e9d1a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1045,"end":1067,"value":"8dec8eca-c309-4e81-a124-8753342eacc8","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"0add055a-10fc-4d54-a58f-bf9ef250b010","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1069,"end":1072,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"46a6f78c-f7ac-4eba-b92b-4c22891ecdc9","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1171,"end":1172,"value":"de7b73d6-2054-4c55-90d8-57977603cbf3","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"16706c23-478b-4d1c-96eb-358c4d59a98e","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1174,"end":1194,"value":"c40c3fba-2236-4df0-a43e-22bf23f9f6f8","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"018c8294-191d-43bc-857b-4329cd1bb757","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1242,"end":1245,"value":"91dd3964-411e-45df-81f1-2f16cd1c9f14","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"0547ba95-3db2-4a52-b944-2ca1920c58b2","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1288,"end":1307,"value":"8e27054f-b9a6-430d-a

And the same day the prisoners in the Stinche managed to break open the prison, and all escaped - with the exception of one unfortunate man who was captured and hung.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"c31fdfe7-7b31-4b25-bf29-81d043450723","type":"style/superscript","start":20,"end":21,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"4227de2e-e333-4cfc-b1f7-7b0959aed0f7","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":34,"end":48,"value":"f4627a4a-cc8b-4a06-afa5-9df44570cee4","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"4daefe9c-84cc-4c36-9ff9-290e349ce4c8","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":65,"end":82,"value":"b1b71dfe-5ccf-4f09-a406-b76f38e8b126","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"cd444275-b4a5-411d-858c-278624a36ae1","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":99,"end":104,"value":"7d12df16-fbb0-473d-abe5-fe192d3172c7","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"2f1f8794-f7f9-4551-a427-064162c8fc81","type":"style/superscript","start":228,"end":229,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"49ac7063-a48b-4e01-888d-f7ef93fbfed1","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":245,"end":267,"value":"4a4e3340-bc95-4504-8380-c472ba3fde3c","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"af5bee3b-3ca6-43c1-a464-6823c159204c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":285,"end":292,"value":"d4123335-f771-45b3-adf5-296e08e05603","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7d8d1d4a-36c0-490e-bcbe-7d3777414648","type":"style/superscript","start":321,"end":322,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"923f8549-8a3d-4036-93ab-695aa8f51e22","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":359,"end":381,"value":"4a4e3340-bc95-4504-8380-c472ba3fde3c","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"204105ec-fac3-4f36-8db3-6c9804274085","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":387,"end":403,"value":"56fa08e4-486d-4e2e-be67-d3ac8c774396","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8db70fa3-2111-4b3e-ba62-cd0846e33eb6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":436,"end":454,"value":"b376eddb-66e0-4c3d-b72f-555ff875bd37","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"65b9a8ed-7965-41b0-bbce-95d5fe6e629e","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":467,"end":475,"value":"4575c65e-9392-4069-99de-efffbd46c7c4","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"9df7ae07-656d-499e-8d02-3b53dea9721b","type":"style/italics","start":467,"end":475,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f8f51f3b-ee24-46b5-af98-bec622d70006","type":"codex/document-reference","start":467,"end":475,"value":"35a3d80f-dec9-4e15-8760-c727c87cac39","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"1343fe04-206e-4d0e-b708-3c41b0e72eb5","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":641,"end":647,"value":"a28a4d9b-fa03-4f21-a335-cb96d907d8ba","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"cd998afb-7629-4422-9841-bd5b13d08840","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":716,"end":726,"value":"213d10f8-9064-44e0-8071-59e97b2a4804","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"41d0f15f-19d4-413d-9f38-ef46e67c5919","type":"style/italics","start":809,"end":815,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"9338461c-1d13-49a1-8b84-0febf97f60c7","type":"codex/document-reference","start":809,"end":815,"value":"668ec0fb-4839-4ffc-95fd-b48f1f04a481","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[]},{"id":"2880105e-7720-4230-90ec-6bd4be9b992d","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[]}]}
