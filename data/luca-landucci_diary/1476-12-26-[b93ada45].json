He was put to death by the populace, out of zeal for the common good. There were several conspirators; and the first who reached the duke was this Giovanni Andrea, who feigned to offer him a letter with one hand whilst he stabbed him with the other. It happened as with Scevola the Roman, when they took life for life. Such men are rarely found. And I believe that they carry out their crimes by divine permission. This was on the day of Santo Stefano, in church, during the mass. And when they tried to flee, they could not, because the crowd of people, and mostly the women who hindered them by spreading out their gowns in such a way that the barons of the duke, and chiefly a certain Ghezzo who stood next to him, caught and slew the said Giovanni Andrea. And three others were taken and hung. Some people said that these three who were caught were quartered by four horses.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"1d711903-b1b0-4d83-87e6-5cf3ac299bca","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":0,"end":1,"value":"f219551f-c528-4666-8ada-4b95b7476b58","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"58a9e0f9-bd9c-4e3f-a277-0eb97861743e","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":18,"end":30,"value":"833906e4-a0a3-4fd9-b1f1-95f5f86aebf5","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":["0|name|Galeazzo
