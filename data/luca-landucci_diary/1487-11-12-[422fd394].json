But after he had been inside a little while, this lion threw himself upon him, seizing him by the back of his head; and it was only with difficulty, by shouting at the beast, that the tamer got him away. But the lion had so torn and mauled the boy, that he died in a few days.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"29a04e75-b395-403b-917e-87d696a9cbee","type":"page","start":0,"end":580,"value":"44","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e741776e-40ec-49d4-841c-bebc2e80dc09","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":10,"end":21,"value":"199afe38-716e-4763-94c6-f4466dad7610","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7166fcf5-f40b-4030-8f12-2c3aa3ba0449","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":40,"end":48,"value":"b64494bf-dad3-42fc-a779-a7ff70ffd8bd","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"6ad469db-bd8e-47b3-9e91-117fc61bc47d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":181,"end":185,"value":"5539d818-3293-4369-b343-801403acf4dc","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f4f924bc-6079-4b81-970b-54cd219b71f2","type":"codex/meta-relation-reference","start":206,"end":211,"value":"ae4ba0ac-bc9e-4e7b-bbb3-67e029f4c3e4","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"c975e43c-6f7b-46b1-a0f0-8fb61cac322f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":213,"end":232,"value":"c5b39f3d-027f-46b1-b7a6-a2142d3e23d3","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"2afdb85d-2ab9-4f29-b01e-937cf67dfbfc","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":224,"end":231,"value":"dc4393af-5aff-46e6-a95a-70787766f9dd","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"22e6b4b7-8253-446b-a1b8-a19396af49eb","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":276,"end":286,"value":"4abbf8d6-ca7f-4800-9789-5be146b10af0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"d3e8c92b-65b3-4b86-a6c5-fa6829d319de","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":293,"end":302,"value":"199afe38-716e-4763-94c6-f4466dad7610","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[{"id":"29a04e75-b395-403b-917e-87d696a9cbee","type":"page","value":"44","metadata":[]}]}]}
