Fra Girolamo preached in Santa Maria del Fiore, and on account of the great crowd, one of the wooden stands for the boys, towards the door of San Giovanni, broke, but no one was hurt. It was considered a miracle. You must know that there were four stands: two against the walls facing the chancel; the other two, one above by the men, and the other below by the women, in\u00A0the body of the church. The number of boys had so increased that it had been necessary to make these stands. And observe that there was such a feeling of grace in this church, and such sweet consolation in hearing these boys sing, now above, now below, now from the side, all in turn, quite modestly and low, as if to themselves; it seemed impossible that it was done by boys. I write this because I was present, and saw and heard it many times, and felt much spiritual comfort. Truly the church was full of angels.
