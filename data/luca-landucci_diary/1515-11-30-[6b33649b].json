Here there were two facades opposite one another, full of so many figures and so much ornamen tation that everyone who stopped to look, lost himself in the midst of such a number of different subjects by the hand of the chief masters. Here could be traced various ideas and similitudes \u2014 there were the nine beatitudes, Beati Pacifici, Beaii mundo corde, etc., and many other series of stories, which astonished me by the beauty of their design and execution; for there was nothing rough or clumsy about them, all the figures being perfect, and suitably placed by men of ability.(1) And note that to make all these things of wood, it was necessary to work at Santa Maria del Fiore, Santa Maria Novella, in the church and the cloisters, Santo Spirito, in the church, the cloisters, and the refectories, Santa Felicita in Piazza, San Jacopo Soprarno, Santa Croce, the Palagio del Podesta, the Studio (University), San Michele Addomini,(2) San Michele Berteldi, and many other places. The said churches were so taken up, that the office had to be said elsewhere. Holidays and work-days, night and day alike, this noise and commotion went on, and it lasted, I repeat, more than a month, several thousand men being employed. There was not the most humble painter of any kind in Florence whose aid was not required in some way.
