The Signoria moved into their new hall, which was now ceiled, but not yet paved, nor were the benches made. The door from the Palagio into the hall was broken through and roughly made, but not yet finished off in any way.\u00A0In this hall were placed two marble epitaphs. One was in the vulgar tongue, and in verse, and the other in Latin. The first consisted in a stanza of eight lines, meaning: \u0022Whoever wishes to have a parlamento, wishes to take the government away from the people.\u0022 The Latin one said: \u0022This Council is from God, and ill will befall anyone who tries to go against it.\u0022 ","standoffProperties":[{"id":"b47101da-8762-4884-86a9-01f8d0ee9ce2","type":"tei/core/date","start":0,"end":12,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":["when|1496-02-25"]},{"id":"52c6b637-f9de-4afe-9e22-9b1da84cb33d","type":"page","start":0,"end":600,"value":"103","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a95ecec9-6efb-49b3-b6a2-037ddbd466f8","type":"codex/time-reference","start":0,"end":12,"value":"2257da51-8eb1-4f57-850c-8db08fd37957","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"cfd418b6-ed19-4b60-bee8-073751cddd54","type":"style/superscript","start":2,"end":3,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"2f5457d4-b476-4db3-ac02-5ba7d8983148","type":"style/italics","start":19,"end":26,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"84bc9d07-3546-4ac2-932b-15f6d16a6847","type":"language","start":19,"end":26,"value":"it","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7da24a91-4388-46dc-baec-0846e30f3dbc","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":19,"end":26,"value":"e7e25450-c79a-4fda-ac86-f59bfa2248f1","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"aa10e443-e6b1-4808-b531-b711765ae2f1","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":49,"end":52,"value":"9e232c3a-cd05-416c-bc59-9b518613f5e9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"fd94a33e-c130-4391-8f5c-3a493d82e717","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":109,"end":115,"value":"0179aa7f-815a-4402-b282-f65360a4e7d8","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"490297a6-561d-4aae-b745-7dd9f6a4ae22","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":127,"end":130,"value":"b36f73df-e31b-4e32-8f87-ef85e861abef","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"6bfb6c91-55be-40cb-a946-bb9ee70846a8","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":141,"end":147,"value":"b376eddb-66e0-4c3d-b72f-555ff875bd37","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"3eeb923e-f19c-4260-8eff-370b8f64c7c8","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":158,"end":161,"value":"9e232c3a-cd05-416c-bc59-9b518613f5e9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a946bceb-922a-445c-881d-12d3741fe049","type":"codex/document-reference","start":236,"end":236,"value":"daefd38f-1608-405a-9e55-2d0b8271c007","zeroPoint":true,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a9385081-5466-4ad7-87ff-cdc937790a5b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":245,"end":248,"value":"9e232c3a-cd05-416c-bc59-9b518613f5e9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"aa51507b-4c53-45bf-addc-e31f0289bb9f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":273,"end":280,"value":"f6019207-9cb0-4b89-81c7-b98ef4272802","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"0d1bbba6-e33b-4e19-b826-7b757f26bcf5","type":"style/italics","start":434,"end":443,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"3b41ee38-df36-4eeb-b803-6a02de50744e","type":"language","start":434,"end":443,"value":"it","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[]}]}
