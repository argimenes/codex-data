And amongst other extraordinary things, it was accompanied by such a violent wind that for the whole day it was impossible to open the shops, or the doors and windows. It last from the Ave Maria one morning to the Ave Maria the next morning, twenty-four hours, without ceasing for a minute, and without the wind abating, so that there was not the slightest crack or a hole, however small, that did not let a heap of snow into the house. In fact there was not a house so hermetically sealed as not to become so full of snow that it took several days to clear it out. All along the streets one saw heaps of snow, so that in many places neither men nor beasts could pass. There was such a quantity that it took a long time to melt away, as sometimes when boys make a snow-lion. In fact, these mountains lasted a week. It is difficult to believe without having seen it. And the same thing happened in my villa at Dicomano. I sent Benedetto to clear the house, and he found as much snow inside as if it had been roofless; and this was after a week. So it was everywhere alike.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"517466c7-9465-4eec-be75-a2476226542f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":11,"end":22,"value":"b938cd7b-faae-44cf-9c11-832d6781ef0f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"c8baf61a-5836-4d43-8e8c-111a3a981da4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":25,"end":37,"value":"b938cd7b-faae-44cf-9c11-832d6781ef0f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f949837c-d34d-434e-8c0a-7216ac606fbe","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":64,"end":72,"value":"f372f99f-6b41-4eb9-bd88-a94d20f3fc29","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f059fff1-a748-41aa-911a-75708dcfa05e","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":77,"end":84,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f0bbb0c2-9b35-48f4-b21d-ada0c6837e49","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":172,"end":173,"value":"f372f99f-6b41-4eb9-bd88-a94d20f3fc29","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"64535cf1-1067-4b2b-9bdc-a4a7536e514b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":300,"end":301,"value":"f372f99f-6b41-4eb9-bd88-a94d20f3fc29","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e3cdd917-a8a2-47da-9b4d-fde448926093","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":317,"end":325,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"baf1ae5b-f029-410d-9626-ccd3a8039483","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":346,"end":354,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"0745f620-9cfb-4a27-8d34-d65328a51c8b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1029,"end":1030,"value":"5d9cbd12-a35b-4b1c-9130-36c6786145b2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"342c98f5-7f83-49b6-b338-c260755f0547","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1032,"end":1036,"value":"1ffc94a3-c0df-45a4-a219-1c09b416fc70","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"22e7a6f6-170f-414a-907a-49fe47e9f514","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1041,"end":1048,"value":"5b859c68-60b6-41f2-9d1f-94d8761ba031","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"4abd2db3-7071-445d-8521-70ac4bf36028","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1051,"end":1051,"value":"5d9cbd12-a35b-4b1c-9130-36c6786145b2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"4f8fa323-75bf-41a2-b924-4e93e957ea39","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1058,"end":1066,"value":"8c4f1c48-b949-4154-a768-00c81c893b8a","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"9014f12c-f7fa-4b38-aed1-a11b78778c3b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1081,"end":1085,"value":"1ffc94a3-c0df-45a4-a219-1c09b416fc70","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"2123f36b-e5e1-4a3b-9f6a-c00df7dd91a7","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1092,"end":1093,"value":"8c4f1c48-b949-4154-a768-00c81c893b8a","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e351b545-701a-4e7b-8900-9f8b9ce52e15","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1127,"end":1128,"value":"1ffc94a3-c0df-45a4-a219-1c09b416fc70","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[]}]}
