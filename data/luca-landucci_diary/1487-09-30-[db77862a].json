This was done at the cost of the estimable Messer Jacopo Manegli, one of the canons of the said church. It was reported that he had spent 500 gold florins on the setting; and besides this he had endowed a chapel. And every year these beautiful relics were devoutly carried in procession.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"3163f276-5215-41f8-8159-18255fedff26","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":14,"end":25,"value":"c3d56ad9-0ec4-4917-b6cf-00e09865adc1","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e0022ab6-2875-41a9-b862-f46346322efb","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":98,"end":115,"value":"85622b38-96ac-4a7b-b6d3-1551c23c5e03","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a1ed8463-561f-45f3-8411-d067ca47fcb8","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":120,"end":140,"value":"3fddb1cf-9959-4149-8e29-57448f27e8ad","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"4c3ca356-ae79-4981-b270-ed3a8813174c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":349,"end":369,"value":"53af7f48-359c-45a5-8ef1-2167c18a1582","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[]},{"id":"32c8294a-a339-4f73-b970-231c92615b2f","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[]},{"id":"9fd22b93-be10-4b8a-a2bc-51a2387a60fb","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[]}]}
