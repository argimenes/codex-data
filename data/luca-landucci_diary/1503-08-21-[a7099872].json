We heard that Valentino was dead, and also four cardinals. This was not true; only one cardinal was dead. It was said that Valentino had poisoned a flask of wine and that this cardinal died in consequence; and it was said besides that the Pope had also drunk of it by mistake. If so, for the sake of poisoning the cardinals, he had poisoned his father. God only knows if it were true or not; anyway, the Pope lay dying for a day or two. See what a situation Valentino is in now, with so many enemies besetting him!","standoffProperties":[{"id":"fef042d9-9b9d-4ec8-9776-1e3fe0e66b48","type":"page","start":0,"end":526,"value":"206","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"b06bd43d-2c46-4834-8495-929dd0d8eb5e","type":"codex/time-reference","start":0,"end":10,"value":"4da3968a-47ae-48ee-941a-2adee80979b8","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"05eeae5f-2637-40aa-ada2-03adae0da8a2","type":"style/superscript","start":2,"end":3,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"db3a7c11-d928-44e9-be16-96a1ff2fca2d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":13,"end":14,"value":"f219551f-c528-4666-8ada-4b95b7476b58","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"6b1e45d0-4745-4d56-9ce7-149b143229b7","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":27,"end":35,"value":"ff55ba91-e5d9-4551-90a6-ab5ef9c11085","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"bb6387be-da93-4583-95a4-f095ff98d84b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":96,"end":107,"value":"613436f5-e448-4dbe-af30-5d71d6ff0191","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"14ad3c2e-3c5d-4d6f-8539-2f5b2ab1f10b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":136,"end":144,"value":"ff55ba91-e5d9-4551-90a6-ab5ef9c11085","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"decabd6a-0a17-4d97-974c-108167f25f6f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":161,"end":165,"value":"c29188a1-4f3c-475a-8d4f-9ef2655df5a1","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f8f94595-d41e-4f4b-844f-dc8ac3d26953","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":252,"end":255,"value":"840613cd-b2cb-4d66-a54f-f61c1ed182cb","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"4664402a-e88b-45ed-bc90-3d8ba1f789ee","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":275,"end":276,"value":"c29188a1-4f3c-475a-8d4f-9ef2655df5a1","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f384af11-0ec0-4b69-8d9b-5fcf9e468d77","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":338,"end":339,"value":"ff55ba91-e5d9-4551-90a6-ab5ef9c11085","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"3df74751-7aa2-4f7b-b56c-80c9f895cde8","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":354,"end":356,"value":"ff55ba91-e5d9-4551-90a6-ab5ef9c11085","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"6906e4ba-5fbd-4b81-9c47-0f0a6d02b5bd","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":358,"end":363,"value":"840613cd-b2cb-4d66-a54f-f61c1ed182cb","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"5a10b59a-f540-4702-955b-e611652115c6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":366,"end":368,"value":"a3fed3ec-1814-4027-a2d5-ac598b2fcb6f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e672a5e6-8fe2-47f8-9b26-ebca4297cfc4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":417,"end":420,"value":"840613cd-b2cb-4d66-a54f-f61c1ed182cb","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"ea66e7cb-6719-4471-9037-b7df5d8ae6a7","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":471,"end":479,"value":"ff55ba91-e5d9-4551-90a6-ab5ef9c11085","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f1a2f4b3-c953-431a-a045-530cd43499ca","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":505,"end":511,"value":"bd56374d-6a1e-42a2-9b41-4214c51d1e0f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"583799ae-ddcd-48e3-8356-8fcc3f08ad22","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":523,"end":525,"value":"ff55ba91-e5d9-4551-90a6-ab5ef9c11085","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[{"id":"fef042d9-9b9d-4ec8-9776-1e3fe0e66b48","type":"page","value":"206","metadata":[]}]}]}
