(Open there!) and not caring whether the owners were rich or poor. They gave it to be understood that they meant to pay: but there were not many who paid. And when they did pay a certain amount, they paid for the horns and ate the ox (Italian proverb): \u0022They didn\u0027t pay anything like what they cost.\u0022 Few of us had sent away our womenkind, except the young girls, who were sent to convents and to relatives where no soldiers were quartered; but the French were really very well-behaved, for there was not a single one who said an unsuitable word to a woman. In their hearts they felt a secret dread, and kept asking how many men Florence could dispose of; and they were told that at the sound of a bell the city would have 100 thousand men from within and without at her command. The truth was this: that they had come with the idea of sacking Florence, as their king had promised them but they could not see the game begun, much less won. And all this was the doing of the Almighty.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"45a20338-de21-4fcf-80ba-a524579a040b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":62,"end":67,"value":"f5a3b20f-2d1f-43ce-a26a-d66aaa7812de","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a0300c5e-a30d-462c-b96e-84daf70c4e65","type":"style/italics","start":271,"end":279,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"19008f61-265a-429f-8260-8c73c1154c4d","type":"language","start":271,"end":278,"value":"it","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"37fde697-6de2-4c22-adad-12b215cfe813","type":"style/italics","start":476,"end":513,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"dfaf4a2a-32e1-492c-9d9f-5a8eb19e17ff","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":730,"end":735,"value":"f5a3b20f-2d1f-43ce-a26a-d66aaa7812de","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"34b60f46-3d2b-47e8-a433-e180abd166c3","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":910,"end":917,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"84152179-0795-46f4-af6a-11548521a04c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1125,"end":1132,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"312d8557-ca6b-420b-b7ba-8f26a591fdf6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1255,"end":1262,"value":"a3fed3ec-1814-4027-a2d5-ac598b2fcb6f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[]},{"id":"0ec095bc-afb4-4e74-9538-706169497b5a","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"On this same day, five ambassadors were chosen to go to the King of France, who was at Pisa.
