We heard that the Pope was so incensed with the Florentines that nothing would appease him. Many merchants received letters which made them fear lest their places of business in Rome should be sacked. Besides this there were letters saying that Fra Mariano da Ghignazzano was fanning the flame to the best of his ability, having preached one sermon amongst others, in Rome, in which he called Fra Girolamo a drunkard; and he became so enraged during his sermon, at which several cardinals were present, that he said that if it were not for his respect for the Pope, he would use still coarser language, and he actually dared to make unseemly gestures in the pulpit (according to what was said by those who came from Rome). This shows what envy can do! And observe, it appeared to be envy, because before he was excommunicated they were still more inimical and accused him\u00A0falsely. Thus it appeared as if it were only envy, but may be not.
