Cries of Popolo e Liberta immediately resounded everywhere, and in less than half an hour the whole city was in arms, men of classes rushing to the Piazza with incredible haste, and with deafening cries of Popolo e Liberta. I verily believe that if the whole world had come against them, such a union could not have been broken; it being permitted by the Lord that the people should make such a demonstration, during this danger from the French, who had come to Florence with the evil intent of sacking it. But when they saw of what sort the people were, their heart failed them. As soon as the truth was known, that no armed men were approaching, a proclamation was made ordering all to lay aside their weapons, an this was about the dinner-hour. The Gonfaloni, however, remained on guard day and night, with a good number of men; and horsemen and foot-soldiers belonging to the King of France were continually entering. The Signoria had had the Porta di San Friano opened. This evening the King of France remained at Empoli; and more than 6 thousand men came before the king, and as many with him, and another 6 thousand behind him. And at this time the taxes were lightened and many pardons granted.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"cb469b17-2c90-4584-a9f0-d065a47df65a","type":"page","start":0,"end":0,"value":"63","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"3748c8db-d83f-447e-adec-03cf1f9c669d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":21,"end":26,"value":"dd1982d9-b1a5-4429-af68-92d184193bbf","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"cb22ad0e-5d4d-4dea-bace-fa38cc2d5788","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":60,"end":75,"value":"834b671c-fff6-49a4-9b17-fdcc4c13575e","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"0b27cfec-1787-4424-8747-a794733501a9","type":"style/italics","start":60,"end":76,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"eb5cf04a-9bd8-4a12-a08f-ca54734a0dbf","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":146,"end":153,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"eb8ced16-36cb-4ec6-a49c-76fb6ac79f04","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":169,"end":184,"value":"ecd34265-29a2-424c-b5c8-749663f155e1","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"07adb81b-7a2a-4791-938d-4167efc344da","type":"style/italics","start":196,"end":211,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"c5a46fea-2fd6-4771-b069-590a364bca97","type":"language","start":196,"end":211,"value":"it","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"9dacd422-19f7-4584-b7d8-ef33367857db","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":335,"end":340,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"2481873d-19e0-4415-ac47-304cc39ecd89","type":"style/italics","start":393,"end":408,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"35aa2248-7afb-44ed-99ab-aa3b1dbb2ba3","type":"language","start":393,"end":408,"value":"it","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"11f2ef8b-9d6b-4ba4-ba51-50aef2c23a9b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":411,"end":411,"value":"5d9cbd12-a35b-4b1c-9130-36c6786145b2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"1d09294b-0380-4c9d-a2c9-084c6a582fbf","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":469,"end":472,"value":"f5a3b20f-2d1f-43ce-a26a-d66aaa7812de","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"02cd5cee-05b9-4b4f-80c7-c49d48af1918","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":542,"end":545,"value":"a3fed3ec-1814-4027-a2d5-ac598b2fcb6f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"6828cf78-4334-4e18-a505-1828ada4e032","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":625,"end":630,"value":"f5a3b20f-2d1f-43ce-a26a-d66aaa7812de","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"d19dc1ba-8436-4060-9d2f-ade9399fc42f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":633,"end":635,"value":"f5a3b20f-2d1f-43ce-a26a-d66aaa7812de","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"155b7a6a-6e4f-4509-b40a-77e7cdab6dd0","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":649,"end":656,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"264e7fb7-580e-4671-a8e0-d3ba8ce939b7","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":690,"end":691,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"c0534c0c-2597-4671-9689-839b08ed45d1","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":703,"end":706,"value":"f5a3b20f-2d1f-43ce-a26a-d66aaa7812de","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"c0cb08f3-d12e-4497-95bf-74c04b8fe77e","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":742,"end":746,"value":"f5a3b20f-2d1f-43ce-a26a-d66aaa7812de","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"0528cbe0-e847-4df0-8470-7910286c15de","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":761,"end":764,"value":"f5a3b20f-2d1f-43ce-a26a-d66aaa7812de","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"0c305df4-6423-466d-933e-7ed054aad1a7","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":885,"end":889,"value":"f5a3b20f-2d1f-43ce-a26a-d66aaa7812de","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"98c7639b-402f-4164-99d7-847a4fc19a18","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":939,"end":947,"value":"b1047e33-17a5-4030-90e3-e40a7fb94a70","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"dffeddc4-f410-4c6c-a518-29d36b506798","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1067,"end":1080,"value":"41884edb-f515-46f5-8329-8485167274d8","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"5197abf2-2940-45fd-9607-a710e037dbce","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1113,"end":1120,"value":"a59d1c2f-cb2b-4389-a602-dafa6954b9de","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7da7b213-9c08-4ff8-85c9-9c2569dc9eb7","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1134,"end":1152,"value":"67c65583-830b-4d11-99f7-c31649ea4195","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"78507f59-411c-404f-9ab7-50d3784737b2","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1179,"end":1192,"value":"41884edb-f515-46f5-8329-8485167274d8","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7c56402b-969f-4351-b4f9-a4e63bd47a1d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1206,"end":1211,"value":"5de28851-1c18-43ce-a206-02aee5dfa4fc","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e1098946-cab8-4d53-bb08-1d7dbda67caf","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1282,"end":1284,"value":"41884edb-f515-46f5-8329-8485167274d8","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7d08244c-fe45-4650-bd13-be33ed4a2588","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1
