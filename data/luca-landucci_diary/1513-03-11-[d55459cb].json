Two hours before dawn a rumour arose in Florence that the Cardinal de\u0027 Medici was Pope; and there was much bell-ringing, and bonfires were lighted in many\u00A0parts of the city, with such joy and commotion, and such persistent cries of Palle! that it made everyone get up, even the women, and go to the windows; it began at 8 in the morning (4 a.m.), by someone going about crying through the city that he had been elected; nevertheless no news had come, for on inquiring at the Palagio de\u0027 Signori and the palace of the Medici, we were told that there was no news yet. It was quite impossible, however, to do anything but cry Palle! the whole day, although nothing was known. It seemed as if the people guessed what had happened, in the most marvellous way; for it is a true proverb which says: Vox popoli, vox Dei; but to intelligent people it looked rather foolish to be ringing the bells and making bonfires before we knew the truth.

If there had been bonfires and rejoicings before, they were redoubled now, and in a different spirit; innumerable bundles of brushwood, great branches, baskets, barrels, and whatever each poor man chanced to have in his house; all the smallest streets of the city did their part, without stint and the people not yet being content, ran all over Florence to pull down the wooden roofs above the shops and everywhere, burning up everything. They put the whole city in great danger, and if the \u0022Eight\u0022 had not made a proclamation that no more roofs were to be pulled down and that the Piagnoni were no longer to be insulted, on pain of the gallows, even the tiled roofs would have been destroyed and the shops looted. And this nuisance lasted all Friday and Saturday, bonfires continuing, and illuminations on the Palagio, up on the cupola, on the gates, and everywhere, with so much firing of cannon and continual cries of Palle! Papa Lione! that it seemed as if the city were upside-down, and anyone who had seen it from overhead would have said: \u0022Florence is burning down the whole city,\u0022 for there was such a tumult of shouting, and fires, and smoke, and reports of the cannon, large and small; and on Sunday the same, and on Monday worse than ever. They placed up on the gallery behind the parapets of the Palagio, a gilt malmsey cask at each corner, full of firewood and other stuff to burn, and also on the ringhiera and in the Piazza many gilt casks\u00A0were burnt, accompanied by the continual sound of the spingards (small guns). It was really incredible what a number of fires there were in the city; every single person had one at his door. And in addition to this, they made several triumphal cars, and every evening set light to one in front of the house of the Medici in their honour; one was of discord, war, and fear, whilst another was of peace, and this latter they did not burn, as if to express that there was an end of all passions, and peace remained triumphant.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"e9a256fc-25cf-43bf-82fd-869acdbd3c7a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":81,"end":99,"value":"bb12aae3-2a50-4ce4-a7d2-a892ae264f74","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7393003f-2714-4a66-8075-0664a813c123","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":118,"end":121,"value":"c53cd0cd-02a5-4382-9987-ac2e2ccc88f8","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"5efb207d-7197-47f4-b640-4bb28e037de0","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":141,"end":147,"value":"076869c8-8709-47e7-bbd8-8ed9a64058dd","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"04a5aac8-dcf6-4df2-a543-3e20dab7ea45","type":"hyphen","start":171,"end":171,"value":null,"zeroPoint":true,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e1b26286-e031-4bc8-b8e5-8fec5d942258","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":409,"end":412,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8b1fdad8-bd77-4701-a8c7-0fd19e1ed386","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":495,"end":502,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"57d66229-683d-4bcf-a392-11890331ad04","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":608,"end":611,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e058e1c8-907a-4ab0-a9cf-66f2149e6ae6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":642,"end":646,"value":"3c9f5b52-4080-471d-9a14-955bacce7ef9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"efa0ae2f-9c9e-4020-9236-f064d093f1f4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":732,"end":739,"value":"09148106-8996-4c13-9927-a18d46aaf627","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f35739f9-3e93-41c8-9b3b-5bc4b07aff9e","type":"language","start":732,"end":739,"value":"it","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"14ee6e60-02f1-4a1f-b391-bcd326e6824a","type":"style/italics","start":732,"end":739,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"09eee9c5-8a53-4151-b4a1-438f694fd341","type":"codex/document-reference","start":740,"end":740,"value":"432bc562-0f85-42c8-8d27-dad373ad2744","zeroPoint":true,"metadata":[]},{"id":"825faec2-f8df-4cc4-a60f-f0bffb40cacd","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":961,"end":967,"value":"b376eddb-66e0-4c3d-b72f-555ff875bd37","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"139048b1-984d-4fc3-a224-d4925d7e5ebb","type":"style/italics","start":961,"end":967,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"b3e204d8-264f-41de-a44e-8dbd0362bd13","type":"language","start":961,"end":967,"value":"it","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"ca2e9635-3d4e-4bfe-a4e2-9328b63d0907","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":980,"end":985,"value":"d59eb2cf-a3ed-4f04-8f75-1a2bfd70e257","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a90a9157-f47c-4b19-979a-3b4e4837eb7d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":995,"end":999,"value":"8dda2f71-d595-4234-8780-0787b0052d72","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"ce554494-38d0-4019-bee7-c4c37fd483b9","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1071,"end":1076,"value":"d009a377-5238-43de-838c-bee789dc57d9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a399f35e-cd8a-48f9-822a-1e21f3b9cae7","type":"language","start":1071,"end":1088,"value":"it","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"4c8dcc1d-4996-4b16-8bf3-ca6645a1dd93","type":"style/italics","start":1071,"end":1088,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"751cd662-14c2-4a1a-99bb-b1c68e25e3cf","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1078,"end":1088,"value":"076869c8-8709-47e7-bbd8-8ed9a64058dd","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"6bb0d760-6a73-48e2-942f-b9b3af83c531","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1115,"end":1118,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8e8aa990-9f6a-4242-bcd6-baa6840ad114","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1162,"end":1163,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a4c65c01-d017-4c57-bc21-9a80a260319b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1197,"end":1204,"value":"f219551f-c528-4666-8ada-4b95b7476b58","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"35b03955-198f-4907-9e1a-ca621e9f5e11","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1232,"end":1235,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"b06d4b43-2561-4a96-8f81-29baf8dc8f69","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1423,"end":1429,"value":"f8c87136-d474-4ec7-a07e-152cbf3237a9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"5763050d-8570-4aab-8d55-c867fe884a6d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1442,"end":1449,"value":"83d81a7d-c72c-4f53-a55a-a6f757d20668","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"dc03194a-585b-442a-948e-21885d3b577b","type":"language","start":1458,"end":1464,"value":"it","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"b8047dd6-1ad3-4507-886d-732e48301b9b","type":"style/italics","start":1458,"end":1464,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"cda7f5a7-c1cc-4516-88fd-477d5ea41d8c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1458,"end":1464,"value":"b376eddb-66e0-4c3d-b72f-555ff875bd37","zeroPoint":false,
