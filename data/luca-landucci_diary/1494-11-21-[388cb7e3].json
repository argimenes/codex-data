The French seemed to be becoming more and more masters of the place; they did not allow the citizens to go about armed, day or night, but took away their weapons, and kept striking and stabbing them. No one ventured to speak or to go out after the Ave Maria (at 5 o\u0027clock); and the French went about robbing in the night, their guards parading the city. Everyone was so discouraged and intimidated, that when they saw anyone carrying stones or gravel they went crazy and struck out.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"a31d67ea-5144-4c90-8e62-578e8a4b9c9b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":4,"end":7,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8e4107e8-3317-47ad-8fac-dc8ff658dae4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":89,"end":92,"value":"41884edb-f515-46f5-8329-8485167274d8","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"eff936fe-b4e0-4b5b-be3e-0ebaba3585fa","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":134,"end":139,"value":"f5a3b20f-2d1f-43ce-a26a-d66aaa7812de","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"d2ba4dbd-5cf9-4e8a-8199-5cd55761301b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":192,"end":196,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"aeee8ec0-27d4-4079-8198-f26c736381ad","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":222,"end":229,"value":"40656daf-cbce-4d89-9e50-6d9501b2eb54","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"119a4add-1ab3-4af7-8ae8-08511fa2498e","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":278,"end":282,"value":"40656daf-cbce-4d89-9e50-6d9501b2eb54","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"0ea0f6da-5404-48d9-97a2-efe9b4148e48","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":324,"end":327,"value":"40656daf-cbce-4d89-9e50-6d9501b2eb54","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a10e21a4-8363-4b00-8586-d1c90d8f9e6d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":378,"end":386,"value":"8965eb56-f2a4-45e6-bf94-3836aca7f571","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f728de07-904e-4f98-9036-dbd00230d84f","type":"language","start":378,"end":386,"value":"la","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"38ee944b-f569-43c7-b55a-353bae83caf0","type":"style/italics","start":378,"end":386,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"549970e9-e5b1-4cef-8d04-33e3e0ed3b43","type":"codex/time-reference","start":392,"end":400,"value":"d4908716-7a99-440a-97d3-67ecc6d325b6","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"5d502394-ea0c-4dce-854c-c5a66baabba4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":412,"end":417,"value":"f5a3b20f-2d1f-43ce-a26a-d66aaa7812de","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"6904231c-8eb3-4e81-bc3f-cc7195460392","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":478,"end":481,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[]}]}
