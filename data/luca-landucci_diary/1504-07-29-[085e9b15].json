A thing happened hardly worth writing about, yet as it was much spoken of by many people and one kept hearing details for a long time, I will mention it, namely: Various persons are supposed to have seen a\u00A0number of men-at-arms appear in a meadow near Bologna; and Messer Giovanni sending to know what they wanted, one man went to speak to them, whilst the others watched. He was seen to be slain as soon as he reached them; but a short time afterwards he came back, saying he had seen nothing. And someone saw a bugler come out of a wood, followed by soldiers on foot, and then by mounted men-at-arms; and when they reached the meadows they came to blows and many were killed; and then many carts came out of the wood and picked up the dead and carried them away. This was seen by many people from a little distance, but when they went near they saw nothing: and this happened several times. It was said to signify a great slaughter by the sword.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"fd024d71-92a0-49f8-861d-c0d6d3921a22","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":0,"end":8,"value":"5e203dc6-c728-4471-aa5d-a4fef0daaf35","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f4dc2281-1197-4df7-b7c7-6733af2339c8","type":"page","start":0,"end":216,"value":"215","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"cabb4c76-1a50-4fe9-b46c-3a06c9b72b16","type":"codex/time-reference","start":0,"end":8,"value":"550ea5cf-6a4f-44d7-a335-033edeabbb90","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"118241e6-e325-4166-a3a2-e23b1275ac57","type":"style/superscript","start":2,"end":3,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"06b06708-e47f-4ef3-a257-126de10b11bb","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":13,"end":17,"value":"010c679f-0e86-4621-bc17-2c6acc07c5b5","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"235e9d8b-28d0-4fff-9c1f-f9479335639d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":63,"end":64,"value":"010c679f-0e86-4621-bc17-2c6acc07c5b5","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a20901e7-ec42-4fc3-adad-e67265c760a4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":93,"end":98,"value":"c9d94d78-e7ba-48ee-beb2-1f44a0fdc0d3","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"69cfaa99-e17b-418c-89f2-2455660764a9","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":146,"end":146,"value":"5d9cbd12-a35b-4b1c-9130-36c6786145b2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7740c90e-f749-4c7c-8772-75018d320e5f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":161,"end":162,"value":"010c679f-0e86-4621-bc17-2c6acc07c5b5","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e0a62e94-3316-403c-8f8e-f23ae1e9f0d4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":181,"end":187,"value":"26ed6557-7c8b-40a5-b254-aace9e04e9a5","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"9327f648-9aa1-4b7e-89b8-c438a3d3a05e","type":"page","start":217,"end":957,"value":"216","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f13a85e6-838a-47c2-ab0b-6528d6c41fc2","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":227,"end":237,"value":"2259d7d3-055b-4ce6-8ba3-15fa1896eccb","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a1c00155-a961-4517-8019-4e2543a1c1a5","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":246,"end":247,"value":"ca976240-4df3-443c-876f-bcb21595f6e3","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8ff9fb3f-5381-4e42-99c0-71b07723fe80","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":251,"end":256,"value":"b0e2e462-c3f9-484a-a5e5-b7e7221063ec","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"96d1ba3c-6c45-44a5-85e3-114e6a72e26a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":258,"end":261,"value":"ead6fb94-8d02-4282-b323-2d399187e8a7","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"952c1320-2fc8-430f-a27e-d0a559bffc59","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":263,"end":269,"value":"c8102ebc-3fb5-4919-975a-c0db203bcf85","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"64e3370a-eee2-4f8b-9873-5188c70e7e90","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":276,"end":290,"value":"ef124d6c-a6d3-4f00-8d4c-e537cfc2d072","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"d2e91d63-f39e-4ef4-af55-fca769b99afd","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":330,"end":332,"value":"c7d07fc2-8787-4e2d-9843-bc2847f6ddf2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"cf62b080-ac4a-4f15-a672-e043fe19589b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":351,"end":354,"value":"2259d7d3-055b-4ce6-8ba3-15fa1896eccb","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"d706035f-0f63-4e8b-a176-a75447bfb993","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":384,"end":385,"value":"c7d07fc2-8787-4e2d-9843-bc2847f6ddf2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"d15d9c14-2b2e-401a-9005-2e38a2628cb9","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":419,"end":420,"value":"c7d07fc2-8787-4e2d-9843-bc2847f6ddf2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"08d88c66-135c-40f0-b9aa-f9ad85475000","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":430,"end":433,"value":"2259d7d3-055b-4ce6-8ba3-15fa1896eccb","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"eefc8179-0278-42bf-8bec-c8493d9316ae","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":464,"end":465,"value":"c7d07fc2-8787-4e2d-9843-bc2847f6ddf2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"6f888f20-8719-4954-8609-0983771099ae","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":485,"end":486,"value":"c7d07fc2-8787-4e2d-9843-bc2847f6ddf2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"fb13609c-e453-4375-a0d1-747c12267310","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":524,"end":529,"value":"366cf8ce-36e4-4968-a9f0-839e0d5c194a","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"09a85d71-a557-4df5-a7d5-8a3e812b5684","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":545,"end":548,"value":"6afcf1bb-5350-4bb8-94e2-38cb69410f24","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"11793492-c521-4d1b-8c6c-50755a58d451","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":640,"end":646,"value":"b0e2e462-c3f9-484a-a5e5-b7e7221063ec","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"c5e0a188-4736-4589-86df-f2e7443be4df","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":725,"end":728,"value":"6afcf1bb-5350-4bb8-94e2-38cb69410f24","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"526e156b-3ccb-4566-9a52-df9f0d18649a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":798,"end":803,"value":"5ba05c39-de11
