There was a hunt in the Piazza de\u0027 Signori: two lions, and bears, leopards, bulls, buffaloes, stags, and many other wild animals of various kinds, and horses; the lions were brought in after the rest, and chiefly the one that came first did nothing, on account of the great tumult of the crowd; except that certain big dogs approaching him, he seized one with his paw and dropped it dead on the ground, and a second the same, without taking any notice of the other wild beasts; when he was not molested, he stood quite still, and then went away further on. They had made a tortoise and a porcupine, inside of which were men who made them move along on wheels all over the Piazza, and kept thrusting at the animals with their lances. This hunt was thought so much of, that the number of wooden platforms and enclosures made in the Piazza was a thing never before seen, the cost of bringing the timber and of erecting these stands being very great; it seemed incredible that any city in the world could have such a mass of timber. One carpenter paid 40 gold florins\u00A0for the permission to put up a platform against one of these houses, and there were people who paid three or four grossoni (grossone \u25A0\u25A0 about 1/3 of a florin) for a place on the stands. All the stands and enclosures were crowded, as also the windows and the roofs, such a concourse of people never having been known, for numbers of strangers had come from many different parts. Four cardinals(1) had come from Rome disguised, and many Romans accompanied by a quantity of horsemen. At the end of the evening it was found that many men had been injured and about three killed in fighting with the wild beasts; one had been killed by a buffalo. They had made a beautiful large fountain in the middle of the Piazza, which threw the water up in four jets, and round this fountain was a wood of verdure, with certain dens very convenient for the animals to hide in, and low troughs full of water round the fountain, for them to be able to drink. Everything had been very well arranged, except that someone without the fear of God did an abominable thing in this Piazza, in the presence of 40 thousand women and girls, putting a mare into an enclosure together with the horses; which much displeased decent and well-behaved people, and I believe that it displeased even the ill-behaved people.(2) Finally the lions made no more attacks, becoming cowed by the immense tumult of the people. I remember another time when the same sort of hunt was made, more than 60 years ago, two lions also being brought in; and in the first attack one of them threw himself upon a horse, and caught hold of him in the soft part of his body, and the powerful horse, being terrified, dragged him from the Mercatantia(3) to the middle of the Piazza; the lion got nothing but the mouthful of skin that was torn off; and this fact caused such a tumult, that the said lion was frightened and went and sat in a corner, and neither he nor the second one would make\u00A0another attack. Which shows that there cannot be a display amidst the tumult of the people. That earlier hunt had been held on the occasion of the Duke of Milan coming to Florence.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"9979916d-3f06-4ce0-b8eb-dc295fe98a9b","type":"codex/time-reference","start":0,"end":8,"value":"90b8e33e-1683-450d-b954-cab05332c6b7","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e077a58c-0a28-42b6-8bb1-6b1733e09587","type":"page","start":0,"end":1073,"value":"274","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"68c765bc-2ed3-453d-8ff1-96ed140f1299","type":"style/superscript","start":2,"end":3,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"d3fbc258-86b3-49ab-a4fc-b43da9e0910b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":23,"end":26,"value":"236f7c48-5281-4925-a82c-c3923f29b456","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":["0|name|A
