There was such a quantity of it, that the weight bowed the trees down to the ground and broke the branches. Note, by the way, that this was on the hills. For about half a mile near the river it did no injury. It began at Fiesole, and extended to the Mugello; and at San Godenzo and Dicomano it did much harm. On my land at Dicomano it tore from the roots several chestnut-trees and oak-trees, and broke nearly all the branches of the olive-trees and every other kind of wood, so that at one of my farms the branches alone made twenty piles of wood; and some of the broken limbs of the chestnuts were more than two feet thick, such as was never seen before. Those who chanced to be in the woods, thought that the world was coming to an end, when they heard everything cracking, and the deafening noise overhead. There was such a heap of grass that it weighed several pounds; and the stubble of the corn in the fields looked like organ-pipes. The stacks appeared to be roofed with glass, and it was too dangerous for anyone to walk in the country. The farms were ruined for many years, the fruit-trees not bearing fruit, the olives remaining like suckers, and the oak-trees being all spoilt. It was incredible, but true.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"f4ea181b-762a-45aa-98e2-1a189187dc68","type":"codex/time-reference","start":0,"end":11,"value":"5696b770-e912-499a-99a1-92953dc48326","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"4a7fd144-af85-4c63-a3ba-477a9bd1d399","type":"style/superscript","start":10,"end":11,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"853c0010-4b63-4939-8a39-bc1a7f682d2b","type":"codex/time-reference","start":14,"end":23,"value":"4f273cd6-1a21-4495-8596-f9d410a3ef76","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"4ac1088f-1cb2-4101-891c-49c482233409","type":"codex/time-reference","start":62,"end":65,"value":"39ad7572-ba71-4b86-82a9-434e2135fb73","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"fe25a674-e18a-4724-b936-92ee2c8ab80e","type":"style/superscript","start":64,"end":65,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"9eeb48d0-1805-40e1-a909-d4122b1725c9","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":371,"end":377,"value":"4d9da495-e794-463f-a78e-8b9570674e05","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"9712a95b-bd81-4e8d-9922-ee0589721dd0","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":400,"end":406,"value":"a194d2dd-5061-4f47-9d37-05685d29f74f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"029d3c4b-629b-4267-b2a8-dddb6ffd2e89","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":416,"end":426,"value":"0f465d43-f87c-4fb6-8e0a-8ca34afd0c0e","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"fbdce672-df2c-42db-9354-c9522fee05d6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":432,"end":439,"value":"5b859c68-60b6-41f2-9d1f-94d8761ba031","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"40507f02-f41c-43d6-91a4-faec58eb1a59","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":462,"end":463,"value":"5d9cbd12-a35b-4b1c-9130-36c6786145b2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"4bd7b9f5-8503-4094-aa10-433b301964be","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":465,"end":468,"value":"cd0012bb-b2fc-4c32-b896-d7a9082b4a6f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"ff14efe6-87de-47ac-923d-e73a106e8e4c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":473,"end":480,"value":"5b859c68-60b6-41f2-9d1f-94d8761ba031","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8ef3609a-374e-4685-b100-b9205be171ec","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":644,"end":645,"value":"5d9cbd12-a35b-4b1c-9130-36c6786145b2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[]},{"id":"0353e020-a347-4cb9-aaf7-d7abd5fee62d","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"The Arno rose very high, and ruined the mill of the Ponte a Rubiconte, next to Santa Maria delle Grazie, and a porter was drowned there.
