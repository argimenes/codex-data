About 11 o\u0027clock in the evening the inn of the Bertucce fell down; the lower vault fell in first, and then another vault above, and lastly the roof, burying many people who were there drinking; about 16 in all. Three of them were found dead, and many dangerously injured, the latter being dragged out from corners where part of the vaulting had been held up. All the wine and the casks were lost. The ruin was complete; and it was thought a marvel that only three of the 16 died.
