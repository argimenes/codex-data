Six Spanish prisoners were brought into Florence, who had been captured by our soldiers in the Mugello. And all this time the country round was being deserted in every direction, but the fear of the peasants was not so great when they saw how the citizens were making preparations, and the poor creatures took heart, for in reality it seemed to intelligent people as if there were no such need for fear; on the contrary, it was rather for the enemy to fear, because if they came down into these plains, they would fare badly. This was the opinion of every intelligent person. We had levied so many battalions of militia, and all the men-at-arms were eager to encounter the enemy, for the sake of gain, and had a mind to slay everyone. Our troops now numbered 17 thousand men, counting the militia and the men-at-arms together.
