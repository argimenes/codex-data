At about 18 in the afternoon (2 p.m.), the Spaniards took Prato by bombardment and assault. That they should have taken such a strongly fortified place in one day was marvellous, because there were 4 thousand soldiers in it, and so many peasants of the district who had taken refuge there with their property and their wives and children, having come\u00A0from all the country round, that there was a great collection of wealth; and yet they all became as timid as mice, and could not hold out for a single day. There were two reasons that those outside were so fierce; one was that they had been nearly starving for two days; and the second that they knew there was a store of wealth in the place; and a still more powerful reason for their success was that we did not send from here the help which we might have done. I do not know whose negligence it was, but I saw the soldiers standing about at the gates, and no one attempted to send them away, although we heard the report of the cannon all the time, which made many marvel at this delay. Therefore these cruel miscreants and infidels entered the place and slew everyone whom they encountered; not content with having such a large booty, they spared hardly anyone\u0027s life, and the few that remained they took and placed a ransom upon them, on rich and poor alike, and anyone who was unable to pay they tortured in the most disgraceful and abominable ways. They sacked the monasteries, and they slaughtered women and children with every sort of cruelty and infamy. It was said that 5 thousand persons were killed. It seemed as if it were by divine permission that our chief citizens were so dilatory; having 18 thousand soldiers, a number which exceeded theirs, we had already hindered them from obtaining provisions, so that they could not have held out more than two or three days without dying of hunger, and they would all have been slain or else taken prisoner in endeavouring to flee. It had not been at all prudent of them sending such a quantity of men and munitions to Prato; it was making almost impossible haste, to have taken Campi on the 27th and Prato on the 29th. It happened, however, on account of our sins. And now the traitors are so well-furnished with provisions that they can stay there as long as they wish, and have all become rich with so much booty; and we, meanwhile, have lost all hope of conquering the Pistolese in any way.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"4a331bcf-a12f-4477-831d-360d303461ef","type":"page","start":0,"end":397,"value":"256","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"04932bed-faa0-4fe0-bb51-737cc7dc4ee8","type":"codex/time-reference","start":0,"end":10,"value":"333975a4-2a8c-441b-bd82-dfb1220f90d9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"9784a944-faad-4f7a-ae3b-4b24dc103d8d","type":"manuscript/line","start":0,"end":55,"value":"1","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"6dd19b20-d430-4c6d-9329-cc0fcad7d1a7","type":"style/superscript","start":2,"end":3,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"74c433b7-32ad-4248-bc60-cf34155b2f7c","type":"style/italics","start":24,"end":44,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"ff3aa96c-5908-4fd9-8b1b-e8f9ef7bc12b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":24,"end":44,"value":"ef0a7489-14ad-42ff-b8d0-44cf61cf2c88","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"98f5b4d8-ed3c-4e98-8780-447c22f5d19d","type":"codex/document-reference","start":45,"end":45,"value":"3309a9a3-fa39-4787-b3c3-9b4ade7ebf05","zeroPoint":true,"metadata":[]},{"id":"b6d32343-3c31-45f2-bf5c-cff972fb39c4","type":"codex/time-reference","start":57,"end":84,"value":"5a96a00e-4bd0-4d39-a9f7-9bbd28d8afbf","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"9d50242d-e760-41cb-87f4-c3d65a1c6695","type":"manuscript/line","start":57,"end":113,"value":"2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e5999576-8a8b-4cbc-8358-fd1241c7d283","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":91,"end":99,"value":"bd54b302-0137-4f22-b7d2-c8cefb997f09","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"fa3eb980-7ec9-42ba-af21-241d20c5f440","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":106,"end":110,"value":"ed1f1c87-b209-44cb-9818-6a86b8f89dc6","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8e514b73-54f2-4135-9d0e-680b7ed9aa3c","type":"manuscript/line","start":115,"end":166,"value":"3","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f8cb88ca-5446-482d-9cf4-a59411b612fc","type":"manuscript/line","start":168,"end":225,"value":"4","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"1bf41fd9-6f5e-4e45-a0a5-ed12c09fd1d1","type":"codex/trait-reference","start":175,"end":192,"value":"28e0aff4-6535-44a1-816d-a28fe7cc0572","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e484d52e-d14f-4072-80da-3d6117918144","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":194,"end":198,"value":"ed1f1c87-b209-44cb-9818-6a86b8f89dc6","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"0d9b19df-b7e5-48b3-8950-04c982c8422e","type":"manuscript/line","start":227,"end":283,"value":"5","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8769b4ad-0a7f-4153-b8fb-797a2a029404","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":269,"end":270,"value":"ed1f1c87-b209-44cb-9818-6a86b8f89dc6","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"082c087f-acff-4d81-8cb3-2fa44f75f019","type":"manuscript/line","start":285,"end":340,"value":"6","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"961c9caa-f36c-4ebe-bf5c-12782181c1b8","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":301,"end":308,"value":"3ec739e8-0db4-403a-88d2-060d7655e1da","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"476324f9-45e0-4a3d-9d32-53c34eec7f07","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":331,"end":335,"value":"ed1f1c87-b209-44cb-9818-6a86b8f89dc6","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"58bd976b-f43c-479e-8b6c-92f35c486dc6","type":"manuscript/line","start":342,"end":397,"value":"7","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"24e78c2a-42de-4e33-922f-e8d1a340d75e","type":"page","start":399,"end":2450,"value":"257","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"3b0789f7-1acf-4b6a-973c-d7696335bf9b","type":"manuscript/line","start":399,"end":456,"value":"8","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"2e2e5f64-5af2-4af2-8862-9fa8f823d4f5","type":"hyphen","start":456,"end":456,"value":null,"zeroPoint":true,"metadata":[]},{"id":"d1352e95-8fc1-422f-af82-362d33d3c0d6","type":"manuscript/line","start":456,"end":512,"value":"9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"c5fbac95-c481-4e99-ba2d-12a711a9ade5","type":"manuscript/line","start":514,"end":568,"value":"10","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f2e55ec2-ebe9-4244-aed8-0a1bb4bd81fe","type":"manuscript/line","start":570,"end":629,"value":"11","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"be537076-e76d-4822-ad95-40906e6a41d8","type":"manuscript/line","start":631,"end":688,"value":"12","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7f3ee46e-47a6-4231-9846-50acb2373794","type":"manuscript/line","start":690,"end":746,"value":"13","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"b964e602-dbd0-474c-a83c-19355c69d216","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":735,"end":739,"value":"ed1f1c87-b209-44cb-9818-6a86b8f89dc6","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"9ac0da2d-5f8e-49e9-b958-21224da8345c","type":"manuscript/line","start":748,"end":803,"value":"14","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"c962a3d9-5291-42f2-aaca-7411ae7e22a2","type":"manuscript/line","start":805,"end":861,"value":"15","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"db807267-ca40-4fba-b088-4e0f879b608f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":823,"end":826,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-95
