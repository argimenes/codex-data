Carts of flax and locked chests passed through, and nothing was looked at, and nothing was stopped. The poor women and children were laden with their scanty possessions; anyone who saw them could not help feeling moved and forced to weep. It was voted that flour should not be taxed.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"ea8dd83b-c41f-461a-9a2e-42ff21e3594d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":39,"end":43,"value":"f8af7554-3e9e-44e9-8443-3a797f973c29","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"503cfb35-4b64-433b-bc9e-419497e9be7c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":48,"end":52,"value":"ed1f1c87-b209-44cb-9818-6a86b8f89dc6","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"3bce8c26-9852-45a6-8c7b-41856123f8fb","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":89,"end":97,"value":"4c66511a-90cf-4148-877f-a3ea7a5e728a","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"b9b36ba9-a3e5-42ce-882e-dfc52b42d77d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":100,"end":105,"value":"7988121b-0c5b-4352-98cc-aae4b4f487c7","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f01c5776-f4e9-4422-80d6-8c2d184fc277","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":112,"end":116,"value":"911e003f-e084-45a8-bbfd-43e977cca6d6","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"cebfddd9-730c-499b-b2a1-f073e3315eb7","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":122,"end":131,"value":"f0fccef6-c3cb-4930-a192-66db1bd6afd3","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"43ede314-9726-4e98-90cd-7a63d29ce7c8","type":"hyphen","start":284,"end":284,"value":null,"zeroPoint":true,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[]}]}
