The offices entirely abolished were the Consiglio del Cento (Council of the Hundred, appointed under Lorenzo after 1480); the Settanta (the Seventy, also instituted under Lorenzo; both these acted as if they had full powers, without summoning an assembly); the Dodici Procuratori (chosen from the Seventy every six months, who looked after internal affairs); the Otto di Pratica (also chosen from the Seventy every six months, who were ministers of foreign affairs), and the Accoppiatori (these ten officials were only appointed during the time of the elections, and had gradually usurped more and more power under Lorenzo). The rest were only reformed.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"8a73d031-14b6-4aed-a632-7bfe9bf6d95f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":97,"end":104,"value":"a59d1c2f-cb2b-4389-a602-dafa6954b9de","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"2c5f8c83-3b3f-4578-aa05-a4eefaf3c2ae","type":"codex/time-reference","start":109,"end":116,"value":"2f3a5d80-73bd-415f-a4e1-cabef0f61ee3","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"d36332ad-ac57-4553-b4c5-0b012b5d0652","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":218,"end":236,"value":"38b3f741-c862-4a92-b7ef-276fddfde226","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f435037b-10dd-4fe5-bc32-bbeb490b0018","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":239,"end":260,"value":"38b3f741-c862-4a92-b7ef-276fddfde226","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e84acaee-2eea-4807-813b-5ed5d5a3e98b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":279,"end":285,"value":"e45fed44-17a0-4c2c-9c00-858667a17904","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f7d1560e-9558-406e-908a-f7a5115e20e7","type":"codex/time-reference","start":287,"end":296,"value":"735b320b-5135-4c18-8f2d-b10c16ffe5c5","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"ded8566a-6c0a-42a8-ba79-b449753d7460","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":304,"end":311,"value":"9a3c19f0-5d7d-497e-851f-ab64887f4e35","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7ef91843-9a6a-4dbb-b475-42bc172c4b45","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":318,"end":324,"value":"9a3c19f0-5d7d-497e-851f-ab64887f4e35","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"5add8543-3769-447c-aaa0-92d522e52aba","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":349,"end":355,"value":"e45fed44-17a0-4c2c-9c00-858667a17904","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"b7762210-30f4-4eb8-8513-fdaab69af8b0","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":439,"end":456,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"15f570fe-6e5e-4a0f-b0cf-b0997a5064d6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":475,"end":481,"value":"9a3c19f0-5d7d-497e-851f-ab64887f4e35","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"36140a58-8d4f-485f-9984-db87f51923b4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":541,"end":555,"value":"83f4e5e1-54ac-4b7d-a9e8-78fcf36153bd","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"246590f4-18ce-4411-8098-f2a68402fc91","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":579,"end":585,"value":"9a3c19f0-5d7d-497e-851f-ab64887f4e35","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"0d0c933b-82d7-48a1-a58b-4a5fc02673a1","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":653,"end":664,"value":"3fa8ebdc-ae9f-4e52-9137-41085a3757ed","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7ec06a91-0cb7-4de5-9020-a03a276abba3","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":793,"end":799,"value":"e45fed44-17a0-4c2c-9c00-858667a17904","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[]}]}
