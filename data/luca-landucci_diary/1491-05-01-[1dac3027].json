All the taxes were to be paid in silver, which meant a little increase to the people, as a quarter more had to be paid, when there was need, on the contrary, to relieve them. This increase was made by divine permission, on account of our sins; because the poor are generally worse than the rich and great. Praise be to God!","standoffProperties":[{"id":"3a76bb42-76c5-4173-a765-0f5515b24725","type":"style/italics","start":93,"end":100,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"dd2e682f-9e13-4e46-a804-82074b705d45","type":"lexeme","start":93,"end":100,"value":"e89a448b-9901-4b65-8523-7fa8d42fc094","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"4d059ee8-896b-4183-8467-38228f0dc9be","type":"style/italics","start":121,"end":129,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"6ee03865-419c-452c-94c6-5f448a55d78e","type":"lexeme","start":121,"end":129,"value":"eb38eae6-6695-4b73-99e3-2410aa2000b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"afe7c050-0c73-4fea-8c22-999cfaf59e63","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":488,"end":490,"value":"a3fed3ec-1814-4027-a2d5-ac598b2fcb6f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[]},{"id":"74313b87-484e-4a4e-9566-03751cf792fa","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"This same day they began a causeway between the Loggia de\u0027 Signori and the Palagio, so high that one could walk on a level from the door of the Palagio into the Loggia; with steps leading towards San Piero Scheraggio(1) and towards the Piazza, so that neither horses nor any other animals could pass there any longer. It was also rather inconvenient for people, having to go up and down again. Some persons liked this causeway, and others not; I myself did not care for it much.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"20787d31-e3b5-4a7b-aa72-e84682491e63","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":48,"end":65,"value":"71d34a2e-7b28-474c-ad08-6fbe68bd44e9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"123fd51a-2d03-4ba7-82e6-255eaf9dcf57","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":75,"end":81,"value":"b376eddb-66e0-4c3d-b72f-555ff875bd37","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"bd7debe3-fa18-4363-84a4-5446793497c7","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":144,"end":150,"value":"b376eddb-66e0-4c3d-b72f-555ff875bd37","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"0b96e9d0-2fa3-4f17-8da0-597928ad623b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":161,"end":166,"value":"71d34a2e-7b28-474c-ad08-6fbe68bd44e9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"57cb0656-cc52-430b-b0c2-62f4d75ecb6b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":196,"end":215,"value":"752d5a9a-d4e8-43d4-bc74-68bd88b9a5f8","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8b2f241c-8443-4899-b469-5b17301782c9","type":"codex/document-reference","start":216,"end":218,"value":"af0d1d48-b1a4-45b5-807e-9b31ca177ac4","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"0ff703c2-f3b5-4702-a55d-4f444ccb4c68","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":236,"end":241,"value":"dd1982d9-b1a5-4429-af68-92d184193bbf","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"ce94e9e8-155a-4ef5-9623-5563949ff2ad","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":444,"end":444,"value":"5d9cbd12-a35b-4b1c-9130-36c6786145b2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[]},{"id":"2aae25c9-e0c8-4c21-b797-9b5f23abccc2","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[]},{"id":"b036a1ea-f5b1-4102-9308-9b4751ec2bd2","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[]}]}
