If it had happened at the time when the sermon was being preached (for a sermon is preached every morning now, with 15 thousand people listening), it must of necessity have killed hundreds of persons. But the Lord did not permit it. This marble niche fell and struck the roof of the church between the two doors which lead to the Servi, and broke the roof and the vaulting in five places, finally fixing itself in the brick floor of the church. And many bricks and much other material from the vaulting fell also, reaching as far as the benches placed for the sermon, where many people would have been sitting. Some material fell in the choir as well, but not very much. Many pieces of marble fell outside the building, beyond the door leading to the Servi; one piece falling on the stepping-stones in the street, and after having split the stone, burying itself underground; another piece was hurled across the street, and struck the roof of the house opposite the said door, where it split the roof and many beams and vaultings, and finally buried itself in the ground under the cellar. Although the house was full of people, no one was injured. A man called Luca Ranieri lived there. You may imagine that they nearly died of amazement and terror at the fearful noise; for besides that which fell into the cellar, many pieces fell on the roofs all around. The gallery on the cupola was also injured.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"5efaf5b2-47b6-4199-a84d-c817eaf2c7bd","type":"codex/time-reference","start":0,"end":8,"value":"54a1bd05-1e96-42d9-a799-ac1119141659","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"b38792df-b8e3-4de4-a07d-cbac9f88d1a6","type":"style/superscript","start":1,"end":2,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"d438208e-9eec-48d5-b06e-ca6ee6a3f05c","type":"codex/time-reference","start":32,"end":38,"value":"85593abc-5ea2-4ccf-86bb-73bed26ec9dd","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"094e7731-a9d6-4697-9987-481000bae4a9","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":45,"end":51,"value":"522737dc-3288-4334-a7ec-243d2dc3efdc","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"b3771361-994a-4d9d-bde5-87f122f0f9f6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":60,"end":65,"value":"d59eb2cf-a3ed-4f04-8f75-1a2bfd70e257","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"4d8f761c-269c-4bd0-94fe-44c83e63cf3c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":70,"end":90,"value":"c40c3fba-2236-4df0-a43e-22bf23f9f6f8","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"c48696d6-878f-42e7-bd4e-bf5ce5ad6fca","type":"codex/trait-reference","start":108,"end":118,"value":"61a09ab6-ea7a-4029-8c51-a018298694a3","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"cf8183d2-6d49-4ab6-be7d-f379c58c685a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":108,"end":118,"value":"b63f3164-e658-4e1c-9e57-97dfb3104381","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"5f47ed4c-801a-405a-86fb-9ca12dcc8bc3","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":124,"end":125,"value":"522737dc-3288-4334-a7ec-243d2dc3efdc","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"296f9df7-9393-4b48-8806-81c10632a55f","type":"codex/trait-reference","start":173,"end":178,"value":"ebf3ec85-9e57-405b-8c6e-80c0091a3473","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"60f9bc90-4b5b-443b-ac2b-dfdd5e962aa1","type":"codex/trait-reference","start":180,"end":185,"value":"71a2cfc6-530a-4bd6-acef-c692b3e7b599","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"833a5c0b-4d21-4b0a-b309-7b7e46018e2b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":180,"end":185,"value":"83727dc3-195e-4521-84fa-1e7527fea0a5","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"2ae3eace-a303-4569-8dce-cc6679790b4a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":243,"end":246,"value":"e4b2ffc3-8a4c-43b7-8647-e8d9c8bf8b53","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"ba11743c-8401-4acc-a833-9d9d90b27196","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":263,"end":267,"value":"25c599a6-8249-4bdc-b6e0-2a230c6361f3","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8c8a8399-a549-45e2-8334-f539e7454ecd","type":"codex/document-reference","start":269,"end":269,"value":"aecbe707-bce2-4b89-ab45-5a1e7618451c","zeroPoint":true,"metadata":[]},{"id":"513fbae6-c36d-4bba-9fed-dc0fa320d365","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":314,"end":315,"value":"f219551f-c528-4666-8ada-4b95b7476b58","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"2d597a29-034d-4800-ae2b-22989613193c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":329,"end":331,"value":"f219551f-c528-4666-8ada-4b95b7476b58","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e8937614-60ca-4eb4-95b4-21b6b85cfe3c","type":"codex/trait-reference","start":344,"end":352,"value":"84f52741-97e3-4066-826d-b42c82708202","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"651c365c-d278-4234-95a4-85667df14ccd","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":385,"end":386,"value":"b63f3164-e658-4e1c-9e57-97dfb3104381","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"2bab6aa5-20f1-4e7a-8d76-58acc03db768","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":591,"end":594,"value":"a3fed3ec-1814-4027-a2d5-ac598b2fcb6f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"356e8a5b-1cc6-4488-a894-ddaa1fb0ca64","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":627,"end":631,"value":"83727dc3-195e-4521-84fa-1e7527fea0a5","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"c7e5c7b3-6179-4ecc-b894-ce05713bebd4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":665,"end":670,"value":"c40c3fba-2236-4df0-a43e-22bf23f9f6f8","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"70dbc9b1-b8a3-4d70-96a5-fda94ef2ad33","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":712,"end":716,"value":"25c599a6-8249-4bdc-b6e0-2a230c6361f3","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8900ea65-a047-4969-8d1f-d3b737a0552c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":786,"end":791,"value":"83727dc3-195e-4521-84fa-1e7527fea0a5","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8e66481a-854d-4751-aeca-5b21586618a6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":819,"end":824,"value":"c40c3fba-2236-4df0-a43e-22bf23f9f6f8","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e1226d18-4b48-4ad3-b7d8-6bc656b69ae6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1019,"end":1023,"value":"905c5300-8753-4668-86d4-91a0a355ee23","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"de07c6d1-7daa-4a11-9527-5fe61009225b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1113,"end":1116,"value":"e4b2ffc3-8a4c-43b7-8647-e8d9c8bf8b53","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"2ddabc63-b3a4-447f-a812-8c7dbb8957f2","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1133,"end":1137,"value":"25c599a6-8249-4bdc-b6e0-2a230c6361f3","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"110e1
