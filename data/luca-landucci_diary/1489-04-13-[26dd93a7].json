It lived three or four days only; for they cut off the horn, and it died directly. They say that the lower parts of its body were very strange, and it had an animal\u0027s tail. And another was born at Padua, on Good Friday, that had two heads, and two hands on each arm. This one also lived two or three days; one on the heads died first, and when it was cut off, the other did not live much longer. Besides the above cases, a woman of sixty gave birth to three children at once. All these strange things happened in Venetia within a few days of each other. The letter described the facts exactly as I have set them down, and was sent to the bank of Tanai de\u0027 Nerli. I copied it, and the facts are true. Such signs signify great trouble in the city where they take place.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"2e176dcf-c796-4a3a-832c-7fe078371b93","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":0,"end":1,"value":"f219551f-c528-4666-8ada-4b95b7476b58","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"4e0fefa4-2ae4-4b32-a413-640bef20974c","type":"page","start":0,"end":1011,"value":"47","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f9acd688-4819-4b82-9b15-c6d693d59539","type":"codex/trait-reference","start":16,"end":22,"value":"9cee824a-88b4-4b26-b34b-9cb43bb068da","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8c70f8b7-46b7-4cb0-ae9c-593963315db0","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":16,"end":22,"value":"bd1c98ee-3236-4436-b45a-a6cde78cf08b","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"73eb62cd-f622-4f76-aaa9-01e7a58d0ad4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":41,"end":46,"value":"a0e81af9-c6a8-4bf6-b9e6-1df3223a95f7","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"dcdd0adc-74ec-42e7-8262-60560d1e208c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":49,"end":51,"value":"bd1c98ee-3236-4436-b45a-a6cde78cf08b","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"00ce66ef-94a8-4092-96f3-330eed4122bd","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":180,"end":181,"value":"bd1c98ee-3236-4436-b45a-a6cde78cf08b","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"708d78a2-3b30-4c66-a728-e2cd7b1f7491","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":245,"end":246,"value":"bd1c98ee-3236-4436-b45a-a6cde78cf08b","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"bf83a130-694f-420b-aed2-8e1b7d00f808","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":310,"end":311,"value":"bd1c98ee-3236-4436-b45a-a6cde78cf08b","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"834bf210-3d33-4eca-9640-878778b0ffdb","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":328,"end":331,"value":"bd1c98ee-3236-4436-b45a-a6cde78cf08b","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"cea70c92-356a-4169-a86b-c0b1c2641b0b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":361,"end":363,"value":"bd1c98ee-3236-4436-b45a-a6cde78cf08b","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f0637556-ac8f-4432-95b2-4f33215279bc","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":393,"end":394,"value":"bd1c98ee-3236-4436-b45a-a6cde78cf08b","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"cf1b3609-8a4d-4466-a41e-cb660eaa63b8","type":"codex/trait-reference","start":422,"end":428,"value":"6be914a4-86f7-4b55-96df-5eecb3027e91","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"0bb824e8-a41d-4521-a5f1-d6f0b099d68a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":422,"end":428,"value":"0a228915-f240-4c65-8434-aaddc561042f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"9d1ab1f4-7dc2-4f9a-83c9-273066eb9cbb","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":442,"end":446,"value":"09765a47-9e21-43ff-85cb-510b9f82a230","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"81b59a79-bcd5-4753-a4c9-7d2ca117cba6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":589,"end":590,"value":"0a228915-f240-4c65-8434-aaddc561042f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7fdb4981-871d-4f5c-a2e2-9fe2eeae39ba","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":668,"end":681,"value":"71781c54-5007-4756-a960-7904f20649ef","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"913e770e-9270-4e1e-94dc-0f26342a2ffa","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":697,"end":710,"value":"9675dd0f-3493-40f2-aca6-9e45f9365a9a","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"45aebfe9-c4e5-43c7-a1bb-9d823cb435b3","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":758,"end":764,"value":"a0e81af9-c6a8-4bf6-b9e6-1df3223a95f7","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"ab4b83cf-386e-44f1-b185-c35789df8ce4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":841,"end":841,"value":"5d9cbd12-a35b-4b1c-9130-36c6786145b2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"ce6f6c42-512c-464e-9042-79846781d95a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":891,"end":905,"value":"8f599b72-e7f6-4e72-824f-cd642256e44f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"3e4c5b52-d0b7-4f5f-9b22-74b9ef955ad9","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":908,"end":908,"value":"5d9cbd12-a35b-4b1c-9130-36c6786145b2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[{"id":"4e0fefa4-2ae4-4b32-a413-640bef20974c","type":"page","value":"47","metadata":[]}]}]}
