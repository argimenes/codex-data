Then, when the magistracy of the Podesta was substituted by the tribunal of the Rota, which was soon transferred to the Palazzo dei Castellani, formerly called Altafronte, the festa was held in the chapel of the new residence of these judges, but the bells of the ancient Palazzo continued to be rung on this day, and a palio was run from the Office of Works of the Duomo to the Arno. The memory of the other so-called festa, namely, the execution of Rinaldeschi, has been preserved till our day, an ancient picture representing the fact being exhibited under the loggia (portico) of the church of the Madonna de\u0027 Ricci every year on this anniversary.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"10b8f94e-f30d-4bba-8bb8-59002ccaeecc","type":"page","start":0,"end":969,"value":"187","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"32733de0-d3cb-4f95-8eda-188f25611180","type":"style/italics","start":48,"end":66,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"4a0244ff-52d6-4d23-85c5-02e3570b9ec4","type":"language","start":48,"end":66,"value":"it","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"eebcdf03-6ec9-4575-a784-22569c2f353f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":140,"end":158,"value":"a28a4d9b-fa03-4f21-a335-cb96d907d8ba","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"bfd0db3e-8caf-446f-8350-385edda26a97","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":352,"end":358,"value":"fda1dd06-c48b-4250-afbd-6c7d91633ec4","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a52e5acb-88c6-481d-b4d4-c1d2aa4cf7d1","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":399,"end":402,"value":"542c3743-8802-4e90-80b8-b609a82f8e80","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"80446e1c-fc13-4db6-9da1-67239e55019f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":439,"end":460,"value":"5ad2cfbd-c089-498d-b851-4443bc104fe4","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"5b5e82e7-c362-43f4-901d-69ede2ec9c82","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":479,"end":488,"value":"5ad2cfbd-c089-498d-b851-4443bc104fe4","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"ee928693-7376-41f7-be88-c1b47103322a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":662,"end":689,"value":"a7ee93e3-0878-4330-9277-aa4e5622602c","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"509c566d-ce20-4729-9d8f-6805ffc68c62","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":698,"end":701,"value":"ec8e8618-0c60-46c7-bbc8-f7d5df545cdd","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a51ccd6c-94b7-473d-8ab3-0c125972f844","type":"language","start":883,"end":888,"value":"it","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"6ae3008f-1105-47ca-b34c-68841e865893","type":"style/italics","start":883,"end":888,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"c07d79f4-3159-4646-9cf9-ec686f5a82d4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":921,"end":937,"value":"747c828b-07c3-4f3f-a53d-e25803c5fb07","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[{"id":"10b8f94e-f30d-4bba-8bb8-59002ccaeecc","type":"page","value":"187","metadata":[]}]}]}
