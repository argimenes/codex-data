The whole morning we heard of nothing but the iniquities of Valentino\u0027s troops; among other things they sacked Carmignano, and carried off all the girls that they found there, who were gathered in a church from all the country round. And it was said besides, that there\u00A0were some, worse than the devil in hell, who, finding a woman with her brother of about seventeen years old----(I do not know if I can record this villainy, which made me tremble with the fear of God on hearing if. Such a sin calls down the destruction of a city; and one reads in the Old Testament that a city was in fact destroyed, to the very foundations, for this same sin. Woe to those who have been the cause of it, and also to those who could have punished such a crime and did not do so; for we could destroy Valentino, having three times the number of men that he has. However, it is not news to me what our citizens are capable of; they do not care to put themselves out even for a great evil. And this has been seen several times, when they might have conquered and won much honour, but did not choose to act, on account of discords amongst themselves). Some others, finding a young husband and wife, bound the husband to a pillar, and in his presence dishonoured the woman shamefully and beat her. And thus, at each moment, we kept hearing of outrageous things. When the King of France was here, we did not hear of the smallest case to do with women; and the French were in our houses together with gentlewomen, but there was never an idea of their behaving badly.

The first time the\u00A0Cavalliere wanted to arrest a man who had been banished, and in laying hands upon him, certain ruffians came to the man\u0027s help, and a servant of the \u0022Eight\u0022 was wounded; and the banished man, being also wounded, fled and passed by here at the Tornaquinci, with his face covered with blood. People began to shut their shops everywhere. A second time it was because one of the de\u0027 Baroncelli struck one of the de\u0027 Campi on the head with a dagger, cutting off one of his ears and a piece of his head; it was on account of this de\u0027 Campi having been one of the \u0022Eight\u0022 when a son of this de\u0027 Baroncelli had been put to death, who was, it seems, a ruffian, and went about the countryside(1) committing excesses; this quarrel caused the shops to be closed a second time. The third time there was no reason for the tumult, but the city was excited.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"83d75313-d3f5-4ad6-b1f8-b0fce52b9b81","type":"codex/time-reference","start":3,"end":10,"value":"7b9e5eec-9313-4030-88e3-fe8efe6154b8","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"0b51bb9a-db1e-4d1d-a13c-5de77a754afe","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":12,"end":13,"value":"f219551f-c528-4666-8ada-4b95b7476b58","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"56f10f0f-e809-4fa7-ab60-cfd85bab0f67","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":30,"end":35,"value":"f22a756d-d93b-471c-a7d3-2c29b05f51b3","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"231987e4-8d6b-4090-8fb9-c5b0f8268c78","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":47,"end":60,"value":"e00f4280-9b1d-4b6b-a154-ffa56a7c4301","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"d04ec777-dcdf-44a8-9831-fa6d7821baf8","type":"hyphen","start":112,"end":112,"value":null,"zeroPoint":true,"metadata":[]},{"id":"97bcc768-ba7a-45c0-987d-e9aa5d93c6ac","type":"codex/trait-reference","start":170,"end":176,"value":"a1ed5466-a2c2-4012-bd55-cc21baed11ee","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"ac37ed2e-6d2a-41b0-80f5-276bd47d10ad","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":170,"end":176,"value":"ff55ba91-e5d9-4551-90a6-ab5ef9c11085","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7f5d9fdd-fce3-46b4-b4bd-b9640ebb5b8f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":179,"end":187,"value":"ff55ba91-e5d9-4551-90a6-ab5ef9c11085","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7b3954b8-838b-4737-a68c-fdffd7e9fca2","type":"style/italics","start":250,"end":267,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e5aadd6b-46da-4b6b-8825-d13ebb7f450c","type":"language","start":250,"end":267,"value":"it","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"96497fef-3a30-4e12-8ccc-43e70bbbf10a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":250,"end":267,"value":"dd1982d9-b1a5-4429-af68-92d184193bbf","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"b4545253-25ff-41bf-8c08-70c675c067f0","type":"style/italics","start":289,"end":298,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a89d46dd-d404-4fd4-9419-bf0ffaa3c604","type":"language","start":289,"end":298,"value":"it","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a3ecc427-b695-4baa-aacf-8692ace1ef8a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":439,"end":443,"value":"3c9f5b52-4080-471d-9a14-955bacce7ef9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"43168ded-b5f6-4681-9e2e-a6a38129e10f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":532,"end":542,"value":"8f448195-3716-4a36-bfdc-e72c0e355764","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"37bdeb6e-6e17-4ef0-a8fb-2f04f57ba471","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":664,"end":677,"value":"c77bce7d-7ba1-4539-ba1d-7e4d55431353","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"aa3a8c5c-d94e-4617-9083-fc26b0945f3c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":697,"end":705,"value":"00b0da53-78ba-445a-a55c-55ba94c0d621","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"c99f00c1-812d-4335-9e99-a93a7d491bf3","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":813,"end":821,"value":"00b0da53-78ba-445a-a55c-55ba94c0d621","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f6afcf85-7d73-4fbb-9b59-193687e03049","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":847,"end":851,"value":"3c9f5b52-4080-471d-9a14-955bacce7ef9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"ee2e32d7-cc83-4a7a-acb9-0a80942ff633","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":873,"end":886,"value":"c77bce7d-7ba1-4539-ba1d-7e4d55431353","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"fe1836d8-8b72-4f04-8f28-5a55f7b27464","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":960,"end":970,"value":"624cc3df-36f4-4bec-a6fe-6673d76ef3bc","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"17abf944-5500-4e83-bd2c-62267fdbf55e","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1113,"end":1116,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[]},{"id":"9ce30290-ff16-4446-a6d3-08c297f9ad79","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"On this day Valentino demanded our artillery which was at Empoli in loan; and also money.
