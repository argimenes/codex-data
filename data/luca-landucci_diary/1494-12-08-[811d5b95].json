It was a marvellous procession, of such a number of men and women of high estate, and carried out with perfect obedience to the Frate, who had ordered that no woman should stand upon the stone seats along the walls, but that they should stay inside their houses with the door open, if they wished. Not a single woman was seen standing on the stone seats or elsewhere. Such devotion was shown as perhaps will never happen again. The alms given were not less than on the previous day. I did not hear the exact amount, but it must have been thousands of florins.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"a59a872c-7847-43b6-9eeb-952d8ddf1bc4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":4,"end":13,"value":"bd9f54fa-e636-40a5-bfe7-d5c6b6615f3f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"da14a551-071c-4f61-be9a-7a24f28fe156","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":29,"end":80,"value":"958b580e-6fdc-4ef2-9ebc-6d68e1d962c7","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e4958ba3-b6c2-4317-a01c-8eaa0f2679cc","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":63,"end":79,"value":"f2843bc1-fb33-4cce-811f-4018cd141467","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8da58817-ad55-4c7f-b184-b599cdff19b2","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":225,"end":229,"value":"ac0ccc35-38e8-408c-9be3-055915fcbfe4","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"d8158cc6-040f-44cc-a2de-82febd276dc8","type":"style/italics","start":225,"end":229,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"84ba81f1-3242-458f-9e70-e08e9ca35524","type":"language","start":225,"end":229,"value":"it","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"bbcd796d-af0c-4cc2-91bd-e185837ec5c1","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":256,"end":260,"value":"a79286b6-24fa-4f06-b305-a9c7677d0a1f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a0727551-096d-48a4-bfff-52ef77a98cf8","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":408,"end":412,"value":"a79286b6-24fa-4f06-b305-a9c7677d0a1f","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"76ff1c26-4474-42bd-a399-0ed47107a797","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":529,"end":532,"value":"958b580e-6fdc-4ef2-9ebc-6d68e1d962c7","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"faeafc8b-4e1e-411f-a1a1-e4ad721134b2","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":554,"end":577,"value":"89ba372d-87e3-43aa-8197-7f0d0431709b","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"07fd1e5a-e3bb-4638-89b2-44684a4e53d4","type":"codex/time-reference","start":559,"end":577,"value":"834cac3f-ca48-4f5b-92bd-cca511a49fd9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[]},{"id":"4d4c183f-b371-4764-baa7-7cd7e6e1ab72","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[]},{"id":"2fe44cd4-d335-4228-bb8e-605c11fe2d64","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[]}]}
