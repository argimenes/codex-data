I added \u201Csimply\u201D because a 1st-order token with no metalinguistic import can be either a proper or singular name (e.g. \u201CFido\u201D), and in that case is only denotative (Mill, Kripke), or else a general name, and as such is both denotative and connotative (e.g. \u201Cdog\u201D) . On the other hand a 2nd-order token endowed with metalinguistic import can only be connotative.","baseIndex":3779,"len":571,"lastCharCode":46,"standoffProperties":[{"id":"c6ded5e6-56f9-4901-a77e-e39a21217f3b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":11,"end":11,"value":"48368b53-d13f-4074-b416-ac4ba26b9fd2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"d39c732e-5eef-4b69-a617-4d300b5321fb","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":51,"end":65,"value":"757ff641-3a76-4d2d-b4f0-555f933c1674","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a55d8b46-38af-4d67-af41-6dda89fee613","type":"codex/trait-reference","start":82,"end":91,"value":"02a326e0-eabc-4e5e-8105-dce904e2ff0d","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"9f6ee295-eff4-4f72-b743-f44a0c249431","type":"codex/trait-reference","start":96,"end":112,"value":"b4a6056a-7e1b-4ac2-b6ba-437ae5d71772","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"88ee6a9e-6a01-4a86-96a8-5e435f1ab88d","type":"codex/trait-reference","start":120,"end":141,"value":"3f026180-f91e-4cc5-bf87-1c6f75b59ac6","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"6ce94b72-7049-497e-a3c1-9c5f90ad11f9","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":159,"end":173,"value":"44082e47-07d5-433d-bc97-f31d9895aacc","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"a94d0cf1-fe3e-46f7-a0ab-c97b62e30284","type":"codex/trait-reference","start":189,"end":206,"value":"0dcc609c-6acc-4b70-aec3-c38c2e5020c3","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e3dc8b4d-1b06-46e7-a224-ba2d0be01105","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":210,"end":210,"value":"48368b53-d13f-4074-b416-ac4ba26b9fd2","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7aec994f-d51f-4133-95c7-a51b49d5dc39","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":237,"end":251,"value":"757ff641-3a76-4d2d-b4f0-555f933c1674","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"97f50c6c-7a15-443a-b0a7-f5bb26c08ac5","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":375,"end":378,"value":"c907712e-bfdc-45a0-8566-823f2468aafe","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"fe477e81-63e3-4205-884e-cb48191807cb","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":381,"end":386,"value":"8e9c794f-ec87-4647-aff4-99733ea8ec92","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"dfd517f6-d974-4532-a2df-cd9fbe35599c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":496,"end":510,"value":"44082e47-07d5-433d-bc97-f31d9895aacc","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]}],"blockProperties":[]},{"id":"ebb699d5-d3d6-4bcf-a431-abbda5dbb0d7","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"","baseIndex":4351,"len":0,"lastCharCode":null,"standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[]},{"id":"a27f76c7-4c5f-4a0c-9753-53107bdf2168","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"I realise that what I said is quite complicated, but I do not think one could simplify too much any semantic analysis, othervise the outcome would end up too inconclusive.
