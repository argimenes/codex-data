In this letter it was agreed that, of six statues which\u00A0are to form part of the said tomb, the beforementioned\u00A0Messer Michelagnolo should be at liberty to entrust three to a good and renowned master who should carve them and set them in their places; and the other three, among them being the statue of Moses, he agreed to furnish complete with his own hand. It was also agreed that the framework was to be carried out in the same manner\u00A0\u2014\u00A0that is to say, the remainder of the decoration of the said tomb\u00A0\u2014\u00A0in accordance with the beginning already made. Wherefore, in order to carry out the said agreement, the aforesaid Michelagnolo entrusted the making of three statues, which were already well forward\u00A0\u2014\u00A0that is to say, a standing figure of Our Lady with the Child in\u00A0her arms and seated figures of a Prophet and a Sybil \u2014\u00A0to Raffaello da Montelupo, a Florentine, considered to be one of the best masters of the day: and for these works the said Raffaello was to have the sum\u00A0of four hundred crowns, as appeareth from the covenant made between them. In like manner the remainder of the framework and ornamental details\u00A0of the tomb, with the exception of the topmost\u00A0pediment, were entrusted to Maestro Giovanni de\u0027\u00A0Marchesi and Francesco [degli Amadori] da Urbino, stone-cutters and carvers, for the sum of seven\u00A0hundred crowns, as appeareth from the agreement also made between them. There would still remain the three figures which he [Michelangelo] was to supply with his own hand, that is to say, a Moses\u00A0and two captives; and these three figures are nearly\u00A0finished. But forasmuch as the said two captives were made when it was proposed to erect the tomb on a much larger scale and with a greater number of\u00A0statues; and forasmuch as this design has been cut down and reduced in size by the terms of the contract aforesaid: for these reasons the said statues\u00A0are no longer suited to the design, and could not in\u00A0any wise look well therein. Desiring not to fall short\u00A0of his duty, the said Messer Michelagnolo has accordingly set to work upon two other statues which are\u00A0to go on either side of the Moses, representing\u00A0Contemplative Life and Active Life; and these\u00A0figures are so well forward that they could very well be finished by other masters. And as the aforesaid Messer Michelagnolo is now once more requested and urged by His Holiness Our Lord Pope Paul the Third to work upon and finish his chapel, as herein\u00A0before rehearsed; and as the said work is a great one calling for the undivided attention of some person free\u00A0from all other obligations; and as, moreover, the said\u00A0Messer Michelagnolo is old and desirous of serving His Holiness to the utmost of his abilities, being as well required and compelled to fulfil the same (which he cannot do unless he is first set free from all obligations with respect to this tomb of Julius which daily involves him in bodily and mental vexations): the said Michelagnolo now makes supplication\u00A0to His Holiness, seeing that he is resolved that he shall enter his service, to arrange with the Most Illustrious Lord Duke of Urbino so that he may be\u00A0set entirely free from the said tomb, and that all contracts between them may be annulled and set aside\u00A0under the following reasonable conditions. Firstly the\u00A0said Messer Michelagnolo craves permission to entrust\u00A0the other two figures which have still to be finished\u00A0to the aforesaid Raffaello da Montelupo, or to any\u00A0other artist at the
