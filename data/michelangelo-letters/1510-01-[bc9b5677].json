I sent for him at first because I was promised that within a few days this matter would be settled so that I might get to work. Afterwards I realised that it was going to be a lengthy business, and I am now looking for another house so that I may get out of this one. I shall not have any work done until this agreement is drawn up. Please tell him [Bernardino] how the matter stands. About the boy that came\u00A0ducats of gold: and all the other boys who come here with muleteers give them no more than ten carlini. I was more angry about it than if I had lost twenty-five ducats, for I see that it was the father\u0027s fault, who wanted to send him on muleback in state. Oh, I never had such luck, not I! And more than that, both the father and the lad assured me that he would do anything, look after the mule and sleep on the ground if necessary; and now I have to look after him instead. As if I wanted other vexations besides those I have had since I came back! I have had the boy I left here ill ever since my return. He is\u00A0getting better now, it is true, but he has been at death\u0027s door and was given up by the doctors for\u00A0about a month, and during all that time I have not been to bed, to say nothing of other troubles. Then there comes this dry-scab of a boy, who says, and says, that he does not want to lose time and that he wants to learn. When he was in Florence he said\u00A0that two or three hours a day would be sufficient:\u00A0now the whole day is not enough and he wants to be drawing all night as well. His father has put him up to this. If I were to say anything to him he would\u00A0declare that I did not wish him to learn. I wanted somebody to look after the house; and if he was not prepared to do this they ought not to have put me to\u00A0this expense. But they are schemers, and working for their own ends: but enough. I beg you to have\u00A0\u2014\u00A0that scoundrel of a muleteer swindled me out of a ducat, and swore that he had agreed for two broad\u00A0him fetched away, for he annoys me to such an extent that I can bear with him no longer. The muleteer has received so much money that he can very well afford to take him back again: he is a friend\u00A0of his father\u0027s. Tell the father to send for him. I\u00A0shall not give him another quattrino, for I have no money. I will put up with him until he is sent for, but if they do not send for him I shall send him away, although I told him to go away the second day he was with me, as well as afterwards on several\u00A0occasions, and he does not realise it. With regard to the shop, I will send you a hundred\u00A0ducats on Saturday next. If you are satisfied that they are doing their best, give this money to them and make me their creditor, as was done with Buonarroto when he went away. If it should prove\u00A0that they are not doing their utmost, deposit the money in my name at Santa Maria Nuova. This is\u00A0not the time for\u00A0investments.","standoffProperties":[{"id":"0604646a-e781-4def-ab1c-1a30a15502e1","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":23,"end":23,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"dac044ba-f158-4d44-bc0e-587b3a347211","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":34,"end":36,"value":"21671569-3eea-412b-85cc-08f659f58019","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7f97f9cb-3e52-4504-b27f-74fdb22d3341","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":56,"end":65,"value":"0b4e5387-fae3-48b1-b307-41eccb357cd9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8efc7e54-b99e-4504-9a6e-c058cae91360","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":80,"end":80,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"d4ce4569-7b1c-47ab-b963-7e449fdcbe6d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":146,"end":148,"value":"21671569-3eea-412b-85cc-08f659f58019","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"d95a677b-3d91-401d-96d9-e6de78177577","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":166,"end":166,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"04799fef-afd0-4f35-8780-ee917ad55db2","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":203,"end":203,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"53253b96-f595-40d7-ace3-6fd52eb43126","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":235,"end":235,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"b256ed65-81a3-43d7-abc9-aaf7830abb8c","type":"codex/document-reference","start":284,"end":284,"value":"31ff137d-c570-4c67-b318-f171ef80201e","zeroPoint":true,"metadata":[]},{"id":"00fd0108-f2d9-414d-8996-c1e41d7c807f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":310,"end":310,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"855ece14-6ccd-4188-9e71-e0b3cb39702c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":342,"end":342,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"c251f81b-6812-431d-9db1-9cfd708fc4f0","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":401,"end":401,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"8a0da274-57a4-4c42-a93d-40a048e3926e","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":444,"end":444,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"67326d42-c4a3-4a42-8497-7668af465207","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":471,"end":471,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"96d6b092-50d6-4f3c-a515-e2202d4ea505","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":548,"end":550,"value":"0b4e5387-fae3-48b1-b307-41eccb357cd9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"efc34737-43ec-47c2-9db8-e6135fac4c44","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":553,"end":562,"value":"0b4e5387-fae3-48b1-b307-41eccb357cd9","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"b5a91ac0-03f1-4112-9aca-146c6a60cf43","type":"style/italics","start":707,"end":713,"value":null,"zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"f89828d8-3ecd-4300-992c-a631f3daa941","type":"language","start":707,"end":713,"value":"it","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"e6bb0d2c-d264-421e-9cb1-b014827ed91a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":716,"end":716,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"bb7e45dd-7253-4c0c-81a8-7551cc3735a3","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":750,"end":750,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"2b7fcacb-18f4-47b4-bfd3-d85e3959b379","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":785,"end":785,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"1b10afc3-5879-41b8-9065-5721973fb4a9","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":872,"end":872,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"6bc38fe1-20d0-4ca0-9150-535dce65650d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":899,"end":899,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"ed9f91cd-4252-47b2-a97c-df0e74fd33cd","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":958,"end":959,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"88cdf083-8786-498a-9ada-841386417513","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1054,"end":1054,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"9cabaed3-e403-4680-95e5-e3cc6e44e8f8","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1094,"end":1094,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"36e92495-604b-433f-b088-2973c5850d79","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1133,"end":1133,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"933afa9a-7d77-43bf-b0b8-1498aa627f71","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1150,"end":1150,"value":"add92e01-cefe-4f13-94dd-f00eb82155b0","zeroPoint":false,"metadata":[]},{"id":"7a318578-97f7-4cef-b4b2-07
