No sooner had I advanced some way in reading this book, than I perceived that I had in my hands not a confused mixture, from which one could extract and prize a few individual recollections, but a true and exact chronicle, most varied and minute. Varied, indeed, inasmuch as the writer, whilst giving us notices of many domestic facts, of political events, of fêtes, of those men of his day who excelled in any art, of any extraordinary phenomena, and of the magnificent buildings which were then being erected, represents to us vividly the public and private life of the second half of the fifteenth century, and of the first and most splendid years of the sixteenth century. Most minute also, because the facts, especially the political ones are generally noted day by day, and not all at once as, often to the detriment of lucidity, they are registered by historians. I found, in fact, a book which, when confronted with others of the same kind and of the same date, much resembles the so-called Storie of Giovanni Cambi, for the unsuitable publication of which I ask myself whether the Carmelite friar, Father Ildefonso di San Luigi, has been pardoned even in the other world. Landucci is much pleasanter reading, inasmuch as he does not, like Cambi, intermingle the narration of facts with the registration of the names of the Gonfalieri and Priori who were appointed every half-year; a series of magistrates which one can reconstruct more authentically from so many sources. With the recollection of having read in Macchiavelli that, \"if there is anything which pleases and instructs us in history, it is that which is described in detail,\" I set about publishing this Diary, being persuaded that even in our day the sentence of the Florentine secretary on the earnest words pronounced by Niccolò Tommaseo in the Archivo Storico Italiano, holds good, as to the necessity of publishing, with proper care, the records of past ages which still remain unedited, and the historical documents buried in public and private collections in Italy.

the work of Landucci is worthy of esteem is proved by the fact that it was held in account in the past also; as is indisputable when we see that the well-known Diary of Agostino Lapini, for almost all the first half of the sixteenth century, is nothing but a remodelling of Landucci; Vincenzio Borghini made an extract of it which was included in the Naniana of Venice; in the Spogli of the Senator Carlo Strozzi, a well-known Florentine scholar, many fragments are quoted; Giovambatista Casotti made no little use of it in his Memorie istoriche della miracolosa immagine di M.V. dell' Impruneta, which he dedicated to the Grand Duke Cosimo III. in 1712. And in the same work it is attested how greatly this Diary was prized by scholars when we read that it was going round being copied, which means, in my opinion, that copies of it were in great request. A considerable part of it is also transcribed in a codex of last century, belonging to the Florentine Archives of State, in which are collected many records of Florentine history taken from writers who for the most part lived in the sixteenth century. A copy was possessed by Domenico Manni, and he often quotes from it in his pamphlets. Pietro Fanfani, who had good taste in publishing ancient writings, printed, under the title of Savonaroliana, almost all that part of the book in which the vicissitudes of the celebrated Dominican are narrated; and was also desirous of publishing the description of the magnificent fetes held in Florence at the time of the visit of Pope Leo X.

In the autograph, however, the complete diary no longer exists, as page 17 and the pages from 32 to 72 are wanting; the pages of this codex have lately been renumbered, and reach the number 89, whilst in reality there are 90, as by an error two pages were numbered 61; and the pages from 75 onwards are blank.In spite of all my researches, there was no way of filling up the gaps in the autograph but by making use of a codex in the Maruccelliana at Florence; a copy badly written, but sufficiently exact, which dates from the beginning of the seventeenth century. \r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"05c20b23-49cd-4009-a94e-d05aa1e79848","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":63,"end":67,"value":"c69676fc-9d0b-44b4-ad82-1287c17e1621","text":"Diar","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"2c2c6c3d-58e6-43c4-aba9-013cfb2b1dd9","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":90,"end":96,"value":"2ebbceca-9b50-4b73-a113-f7f3a1a9c8ed","text":"Casott","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"c3762bb2-8e94-4b02-825c-931b2d9645c8","type":"style/italics","start":175,"end":194,"value":"","text":"Bibliografia Toscan","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"946c1716-4d56-4d3e-b41a-2e3c7713b54a","type":"language","start":175,"end":194,"value":"it","text":"Bibliografia Toscan","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"d87c2ce6-0242-430d-a4d7-3a2b52230f9b","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":175,"end":194,"value":"bd588ea7-4dc5-4899-a2c9-290ac562cc2b","text":"Bibliografia Toscan","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"4bec03bc-b8f7-4f05-ad25-b83de26d8ad4","type":"hyphen","start":227,"end":227,"value":"","text":"","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"ec85e38c-5db3-45c8-a342-9dc2d97cd2da","type":"style/italics","start":241,"end":260,"value":"","text":"Biblioteca communal","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"0f242642-8211-4e16-b787-fe7cb9435b7a","type":"language","start":241,"end":260,"value":"it","text":"Biblioteca communal","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"03c5b5ae-530c-48e1-93f7-c97e11c0351e","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":241,"end":260,"value":"273d7534-0f74-4706-98ad-6a26cb90ce87","text":"Biblioteca communal","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"71f77d49-6634-4f63-b432-1e687cc8f906","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":265,"end":269,"value":"9c715d50-cacd-45b8-9295-ba4feef986f7","text":"Sien","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"d08ef280-2317-4921-9cd0-029d2814d8bd","type":"style/italics","start":794,"end":806,"value":"","text":"Maruccellian","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"6c907d85-acee-4ea4-a251-8f0c01ef1be0","type":"language","start":794,"end":806,"value":"it","text":"Maruccellian","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"c5fb502b-9da9-4819-8d62-2606c40b8b02","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":794,"end":806,"value":"d4d4f409-48f1-49e9-8187-686daa3bfd6c","text":"Maruccellian","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"55c18424-8921-496f-843c-4ccf366fcf0f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":811,"end":818,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","text":"Florenc","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"02a340da-7aff-4c33-b806-d3c40312954b","type":"time","start":905,"end":923,"value":"93570f76-e313-4e7d-91b0-c5fbd8d176a6","text":"seventeenth centur","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false}],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"1f891015-549b-41f0-9ba4-3b2c8faaf0ff","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"4fa4e8b4-0042-4849-9260-453c811733b2","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"As the documents and writings relating to the political history of the Italian States up till the fall of the Florentine Republic are so very numerous, I considered it unnecessary to make any notes on those parts of the Diary which concern this history; especially as the writer describes these events at sufficient length, as for instance when he discusses the conspiracy of the Pazzi and its results, the acts of Lorenzo de' Medici, of Carlo VIII., of Alessandro VX, and of Valentino, the details of the war with Pisa, and so on. For this part, as I say, I have limited myself to giving a few explanations which may serve to elucidate the text, especially for those who do not possess detailed knowledge of Florentine history four centuries ago. Where I have made a point of giving ample notes is in the case of those records relative to matters concerning the city of Florence and its customs: and in this I have preferably had recourse to documents in the archives, to contemporary writers edited or unedited, and to monographs published at various times on special subjects. \r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"4c6b6808-dc9f-4dd1-82a1-3a2e92787177","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":110,"end":128,"value":"de2b5dee-0d24-4fb0-b40c-f2fff67e0bbe","text":"Florentine Republi","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"41ecacc4-999c-4187-b576-be8db22a817d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":220,"end":224,"value":"c69676fc-9d0b-44b4-ad82-1287c17e1621","text":"Diar","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"2a039af5-9800-4926-bde6-02cf97afcd0c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":380,"end":384,"value":"1d147bff-02b7-44de-9c24-acb02ff2bea3","text":"Pazz","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"d7b71510-b727-4744-b7ec-03cbf68ea893","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":415,"end":432,"value":"e45fed44-17a0-4c2c-9c00-858667a17904","text":"Lorenzo de' Medic","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"febf0285-a74d-453e-8ff8-06b437f7d1b2","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":438,"end":448,"value":"41884edb-f515-46f5-8329-8485167274d8","text":"Carlo VIII","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"d4f006be-d81e-4b77-92b1-46883111665e","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":454,"end":466,"value":"401ab64d-0355-49a2-8a1d-05bbf884b3f1","text":"Alessandro V","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"13ff5415-e8f9-499c-bd27-6cec918aeff3","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":476,"end":484,"value":"ff55ba91-e5d9-4551-90a6-ab5ef9c11085","text":"Valentin","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"7c0154c5-cb8d-436b-a753-582204172728","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":515,"end":518,"value":"126d51c8-459f-4f14-af29-5970ffc7fc16","text":"Pis","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"2e9cab5d-1080-4555-9964-7db0d0fdd522","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":871,"end":878,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","text":"Florenc","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false}],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"a8d4f08f-a2cd-491d-806d-4b6cbba123eb","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"fc31da38-e4cd-48b4-a74a-2391c528d319","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"It now remains to say something about the author, of whom no one, so far as I am aware, has given any details. We find many particulars relating to the life of himself and his family in the Diary; others we obtain from the declarations for the Catasti and the Decime (taxes), which confirm me in the belief that he was son of an Antonio, son of Luca di Landuccio, a Florentine citizen, described in the gonfalone (the division under one banner) of the Chiavi(1) of the quarter of S. Giovanni, inhabiting the parish of S. Pier Maggiore. This Antonio, a native of the manor of Dicomano, was not without fortune, especially if we take into account the possessions of his mother Felice. In 1469 he was seventy-five years of age, and Agnola his wife seventy-two; they had two sons: our Luca, and Gostanzo, six years younger than Luca: that Gostanzo, enthusiastic for Barbary-horses, who went to procure them in the Levant, and who, after having won twenty races, came in 1485 to the miserable end described in these pages. Of Luca his father says, in this declaration for the Catasto of 1469, that he had an apothecary's shop, set up with the dowry of his wife Salvestra, whom he married when he was hardly seventeen(1): that this shop was \"more of an expense than a profit,\" and that he was \"in a hopeless state of debt,\" and that the said Luca \"was in bed with a very serious fever,\" and that, if he died, \"he (the father) would be undone if he had to repay the dowry,\" which was 828 florins in the State funds. (This is all according to the declaration, in which it was generally endeavoured to evoke the pity of the official deputed to assess the taxes.) Antonio finishes the lament with these words: \"He did it against my will\" (probably not the marriage, but the purchase of the shop), \"and ill will come of it.\" Luca certainly does not complain of his wife, who had twelve children; he even calls her \"a dear companion, and unequalled for virtue,\" and adds that during the forty-eight years that they lived together she never once made him angry. In 1514, when he remained a widower, he had seven children living; four of these were sons, Benedetto, Antonio, Filippo and Battista: the first probably followed his father's calling, and attended to the household business, seeing that whenever the master's presence was necessary at Dicomano, where he possessed hereditary property, part of which was increasing, he always sent Benedetto, whether it was a question of arranging quarters for soldiers passing through, or of repairing the damages caused by violent storms. Antonio studied medicine, and in 1503 his father sent him to study at Bologna in order to become a doctor; where he evidently took his degree, because in 1506 he was back in Florence with the title of maestro, and was present with the doctors and scholars of the university at the dissection of the corpse of a criminal. It seems that Benedetto was the only one who continued the family, having had a son called Luca, who in his turn had two sons, Antonio and Benedetto, the latter leaving a son called Vincenzio, who died in 1649. \r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"335d29f3-2aaf-4b93-83e4-65eb6f67aef7","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":190,"end":194,"value":"c69676fc-9d0b-44b4-ad82-1287c17e1621","text":"Diar","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"ceab6973-d56d-46f0-be48-0b71c27727d7","type":"style/italics","start":244,"end":250,"value":"","text":"Catast","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"7a82be21-3a6c-4d93-abcd-420d06f7756a","type":"language","start":244,"end":250,"value":"it","text":"Catast","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"b75281d4-c930-4db7-8d24-db1876687db4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":244,"end":250,"value":"da3e8832-693c-4e66-aa30-2d2f676cf0c9","text":"Catast","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"b0a5c1f5-3dbf-46b0-83e9-9fb54496ea5f","type":"style/italics","start":260,"end":265,"value":"","text":"Decim","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"3c8c9ae2-96cb-458b-b53b-6d542f4039ca","type":"language","start":260,"end":265,"value":"it","text":"Decim","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"5dc28366-0f16-4060-9d4d-905f19de5081","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":260,"end":265,"value":"0a04be88-d817-45f0-912e-9ce9cb6ad3a4","text":"Decim","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"46bba44f-89f8-4c9d-b2e0-b4409606f39c","type":"style/italics","start":403,"end":411,"value":"","text":"gonfalon","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"5d56de91-4c24-41c6-b74c-bce38dbc896e","type":"language","start":403,"end":411,"value":"it","text":"gonfalon","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"c498ad35-f49a-415d-bffb-036de96e385f","type":"style/italics","start":452,"end":457,"value":"","text":"Chiav","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"284663ee-5009-49aa-aa67-eed238b4cb5b","type":"language","start":452,"end":457,"value":"it","text":"Chiav","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"cbff1c9e-76a2-45e3-89eb-65aeb736a7ca","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":518,"end":533,"value":"b6c8d199-8821-4353-bbce-09d4a416604b","text":"S.

Luca was a kind-hearted and mild man, although living at a time when party hatred and the continual spectacle of tortures and executions hardened the hearts of the best men, one sees on every page. Through strong religious feeling and love of liberty, he was one of the ardent followers of Savonarola; but the misfortunes of his neighbours always grieved him, even when the sufferers were not of his party. Thus, when the Medici were expelled in 1494, he pities the young cardinal whom' he sees kneeling in terror at one of the windows of his palace, with his hands raised to heaven in supplication: and he considers him a good lad. Thus he forgives the man who wounds his son Benedetto; and weeps over the corpse of Lorenzo Tornabuoni, one of the five condemned to death in 1497 for the plot of Del Nero. He followed Savonarola with great faith, frequenting his sermons and taking part in the processions; he was much edified by these things, and rejoiced that some of his sons were among \"The blessed and virtuous troop\" of the Friar. The excommunication of 1497, however, if it did not destroy his faith, kept him, as he himself confesses, like so many others, from attending the sermons, \"because he did not wish to run the danger of going to hear him, since he was excommunicated.\" On which words the following are a comment: \"the wicked have been more powerful than the good,\" as we read farther on; and the pleasure with which, some years after, he repeats, on each occasion when facts give him the opportunity, that \"the saying of the Friar had been verified,\" or that such and such a one \"had come to grief in consequence of having gone against the Friar,\" etc. \r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"1da92095-f417-44cc-a00c-824e292bee9e","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":5,"end":8,"value":"5d9cbd12-a35b-4b1c-9130-36c6786145b2","text":"Luc","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"8320328b-e77c-4fab-8b5f-9c3dcfa1e075","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":295,"end":304,"value":"ac0ccc35-38e8-408c-9be3-055915fcbfe4","text":"Savonarol","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"9e93579a-c094-4330-8720-1ee60d768ccb","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":427,"end":432,"value":"f58ed5e3-a380-4e53-aa74-f7a8e7e7b3eb","text":"Medic","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"21f0eb19-1b7c-4cdb-a164-5e382050ee04","type":"time","start":451,"end":454,"value":"4f01a9d0-733c-4309-bc84-cd167884f79b","text":"149","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"b05f1fe6-2ae6-4c2e-8b01-3c6876bd3379","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":682,"end":690,"value":"5b5e2657-b1db-4499-8f0f-436fc0e1d975","text":"Benedett","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"df1393f6-ad14-4163-a4f0-07df4d4559e3","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":722,"end":739,"value":"e431ab1b-ae74-4ba7-b47b-17d5d8404ddb","text":"Lorenzo Tornabuon","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"c8a5a584-0b43-4794-80b0-56fc2bb63098","type":"hyphen","start":735,"end":735,"value":"","text":"","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"1d938bcc-3c63-489a-b8b2-6a0cd8665daf","type":"time","start":780,"end":783,"value":"74ba4eec-fbc2-4cb2-8587-2675d0bae9f0","text":"149","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"3fe33e16-21c8-4d41-a318-0551ec51954f","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":823,"end":832,"value":"ac0ccc35-38e8-408c-9be3-055915fcbfe4","text":"Savonarol","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"61378428-b107-4b62-af2d-8357eb6e4ebf","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1035,"end":1039,"value":"ac0ccc35-38e8-408c-9be3-055915fcbfe4","text":"Fria","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"a0ae245e-668f-4770-9115-2d831f77b4e4","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1046,"end":1060,"value":"f508c06d-8437-4594-ba3b-4624cadda294","text":"excommunicatio","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"f0158b92-b311-49a2-b13a-9559eafcd43d","type":"time","start":1065,"end":1068,"value":"74ba4eec-fbc2-4cb2-8587-2675d0bae9f0","text":"149","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"25baecc0-d9eb-4382-8fc1-9c4fb891a935","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1548,"end":1552,"value":"ac0ccc35-38e8-408c-9be3-055915fcbfe4","text":"Fria","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"00376b28-4f4a-4a61-96f5-ff1635e0ca8c","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1663,"end":1667,"value":"ac0ccc35-38e8-408c-9be3-055915fcbfe4","text":"Fria","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false}],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"910ff878-fef9-43cd-bf40-3a50b51b3a79","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"860c13fb-780f-404b-9a56-05070cd18ef1","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"This Diary, which Landucci must have written in his shop at the Canto de' Tornaquinci,(1) one of the central and most-frequented parts of the city, near the houses of the Tornabuoni and the Strozzi, was not put together from the vague and uncertain chatter of the customers;

for when things happen according to his wishes, he takes pleasure in it, and thanks God; and when events turn, or appear to turn, against the free and popular Government (which was his ideal), he notes it also, observing that this has happened on account of men's sins, and is a punishment sent by God, to whose will he bows with resignation. But after the deposition of the Gonfaloniere Soderini and the return of the Medici he is more sparing in these moderate comments, either because the many changes which he has seen have made him indifferent, or from fear of harm coming to him, supposing his words were to reach the ears of the new rulers. It may even have been because of the exhortations of his sons, who possibly were not against the Medici; it happening frequently in every age that the younger generation fights in a different political camp to that of their parents. In his case, besides, we can imagine that the vicinity and probably frequent intercourse with the Tornabuoni, all for the Medici, had made him well-disposed towards them. Another fact worthy of notice is that in 1512 Benedetto, together with other citizens, accompanied the viceroy Raimondo di Cardona, who wished to ascend to the cupola of the Duomo: and neither these Medici recently restored, nor those who acted for them, would have had persons about them who were against them or even of doubtful fidelity. \r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"e6c6bc49-f481-4714-8ee6-bbfafd60b0fa","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":229,"end":231,"value":"a3fed3ec-1814-4027-a2d5-ac598b2fcb6f","text":"Go","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"61b5c898-be71-4a36-b7ea-8f90b97fd1d5","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":443,"end":445,"value":"a3fed3ec-1814-4027-a2d5-ac598b2fcb6f","text":"Go","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"77f550f6-e225-45fa-bee4-717f4bfcdb87","type":"style/italics","start":520,"end":531,"value":"","text":"Gonfalonier","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"d8a3fabe-642d-448c-8ada-d3768a13ba42","type":"language","start":520,"end":531,"value":"it","text":"Gonfalonier","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"0b2a36b9-2834-40de-8b97-7081ce2016ee","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":533,"end":540,"value":"3cc05ff4-9940-4eaf-ac32-d2a189b88789","text":"Soderin","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"92959b45-f2c9-45dd-a3b9-562895008151","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":564,"end":569,"value":"f58ed5e3-a380-4e53-aa74-f7a8e7e7b3eb","text":"Medic","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"5d6d5b56-e976-4842-9d38-98ac46c8bce6","type":"hyphen","start":684,"end":684,"value":"","text":"","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"7d7ceaa7-8594-4c70-9510-be095e22b364","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":890,"end":895,"value":"f58ed5e3-a380-4e53-aa74-f7a8e7e7b3eb","text":"Medic","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"4b090f0a-4554-4bf9-b507-038bc742bcf1","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1124,"end":1133,"value":"46a10ef5-7f34-484d-96a6-0adab9df2755","text":"Tornabuon","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"3f03d4f5-f1f0-4036-9b52-84ceacf36481","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1148,"end":1153,"value":"f58ed5e3-a380-4e53-aa74-f7a8e7e7b3eb","text":"Medic","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"ba3d4cd6-d21b-44b8-a530-6c1281231732","type":"time","start":1238,"end":1241,"value":"5638356a-7600-4857-b10d-e482bd59c841","text":"151","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"08a68718-5894-4d7e-aef5-0a8ce02dab02","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1243,"end":1251,"value":"5b5e2657-b1db-4499-8f0f-436fc0e1d975","text":"Benedett","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"5eca228e-78aa-4c86-a948-6b9e0276e96d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1308,"end":1326,"value":"265be177-f92b-4412-b6f7-7bdac5e2c03d","text":"Raimondo di Cardon","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"4686ffed-e0a4-4c76-87ce-3f2c1cc82093","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1371,"end":1375,"value":"c40c3fba-2236-4df0-a43e-22bf23f9f6f8","text":"Duom","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"d07ecf92-66eb-4ec6-89c5-fbceba788a3d","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1396,"end":1401,"value":"f58ed5e3-a380-4e53-aa74-f7a8e7e7b3eb","text":"Medic","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false}],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"a4e7e85a-b1b6-472f-b681-d23177d26f3b","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"\r","standoffProperties":[],"blockProperties":[],"children":[],"metadata":{},"relation":{}},{"id":"3219c265-3589-459f-a256-9f63c64b81a6","type":"standoff-editor-block","text":"I cannot decide with precision when the autograph was begun; but I believe it was towards the end of the year 1500 that Landucci decided to leave to posterity this book, in which he would record certain of the principal facts that he remembered or that he had noted down, and would continue to write, following these, all that happened day by day.

In a republican Government, the mechanism of which was changed so many times during his life, and under which so many citizens held office in turn, he is not known to have filled any official position; and perhaps did not even wish that his name should be written on the tickets for the election-bags. Only in 1512 he was balloted for in the large election which then took place, but it was through the work of his friends, and considerably against his own will, merely \"so as to act like the Signori.\" He guarded the interests of his calling, and contributed to reanimate the Guild of Apothecaries, which was nearly extinct. Having almost reached the age of eighty, his hand could no longer continue the parchment where he had noted down with so much care all that had happened for more than half a century, but his will was not arrested. Although Luca's writing stops at the end of the year 1515, the record is continued by another hand, perhaps by that of one of his sons, whom he had begged that this work, begun by him should not be broken off during his lifetime, and should even be continued after his death. And this was done; and a cross which one sees on the margin in the middle of the account of the campaign against Urbino, made by Lorenzo de' Medici, was doubtless placed there by the pious continuator to record the death of Luca, who, as we read in the register of deaths in the city, was buried in S. Maria Novella on 2 June, 1516. After this date the records become scantier and shorter, and stop altogether in 1542: but notwithstanding this, I decided to publish this continuation also; partly because it did not appear to me entirely without interest, and partly because to do otherwise would have seemed to me contrary to the wish of the good Landucci. \r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"91dfac99-c4b5-4b24-8b86-aab0335f12b5","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":84,"end":87,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","text":"cit","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"4c9844f1-6b39-495c-b508-3d0f60332e8d","type":"hyphen","start":173,"end":173,"value":"","text":"","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"e1d8e1c8-cfcf-4677-bf4e-97214e813b97","type":"time","start":546,"end":549,"value":"5638356a-7600-4857-b10d-e482bd59c841","text":"151","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"fed90570-1647-4bf1-9fae-4d400eba3785","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":729,"end":735,"value":"e7e25450-c79a-4fda-ac86-f59bfa2248f1","text":"Signor","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"ae8aa19d-136c-4d99-bd89-ff31332bd683","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1085,"end":1088,"value":"5d9cbd12-a35b-4b1c-9130-36c6786145b2","text":"Luc","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"5d7ed565-a5b8-4dd3-a88e-6324f6111abe","type":"time","start":1129,"end":1132,"value":"b9fff284-a8c5-4f15-afdd-adcc52aaec12","text":"151","metadata":{"offsetY":-1},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"0104dd8f-7483-4086-a3d6-2b81ec1a0a68","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1465,"end":1470,"value":"e8dcf596-4645-43c8-8b78-cf4498ce99ed","text":"Urbin","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"eecd54e0-2e1b-4227-b0fc-f2f120b299b6","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1481,"end":1498,"value":"e45fed44-17a0-4c2c-9c00-858667a17904","text":"Lorenzo de' Medic","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"a2ddad53-3461-4399-9ddf-7d5eee97b345","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1576,"end":1579,"value":"5d9cbd12-a35b-4b1c-9130-36c6786145b2","text":"Luc","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"00f77fe8-b54a-4a6c-b907-27da07e74174","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1631,"end":1634,"value":"671ee7e7-ae1b-4a5a-9591-b40203d5108f","text":"cit","metadata":{"offsetY":0},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"17ac33c2-c396-4cc1-9157-42ea61002207","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":1651,"end":1666,"value":"bb907e64-e09c-41dc-921b-ddcd07655c05","text":"S.
