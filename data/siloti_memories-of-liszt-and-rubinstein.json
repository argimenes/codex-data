It was not long before an opportunity occurred. Anton Rubinstein was giving one of his Historical recitals one morning at the Gewandhaus for the musicians of Leipzig, and I went to hear him, acting on the advice of Liszt. I was to go back to Weimar after the concert, and tell him all about it. It was a recital of Beethoven’s sonatas. Rubinstein was at his best, and played each one better than the last. I was particularly struck with his rendering of the “Moonlight” sonata, which seemed to me simply marvelous. Two hours later I was back at Liszt’s house, arriving just at the beginning of a lesson. I could hardly wait to say good-afternoon to Liszt before plunging into a breathless description of this amazing music, the glamor of which was still over me. Speaking with all the fervor and enthusiasm of youth, I told him how wonderful Rubinstein’s execution had been, and that I had never heard such a fine rendering of the “Moonlight” sonata.\r","standoffProperties":[{"id":"5e9e6f1a-7c9c-434e-89cf-03c7205f3140","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":0,"end":0,"value":"ac797137-11ec-4d4e-91fe-aac175ad790e","text":"","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"47282057-f355-46bd-a4c9-d90473b4920a","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":81,"end":86,"value":"ac797137-11ec-4d4e-91fe-aac175ad790e","text":"mysel","metadata":{},"plugin":null,"isDeleted":false},{"id":"64549196-7ac0-4e54-8b98-d16cbf68c540","type":"codex/entity-reference","start":137,"end":152,"value":"18c61942-c363-44fc-b833-5302bafac40b","text":"Anton

Rubinstein had played on a beautiful Bechstein in a hall with very good acoustic properties; Liszt was playing in a little carpeted room, in which small space thirty-five to forty people were sitting, and the piano was worn out, unequal and discordant. He had only played the opening triplets, however, when I felt as if the room no longer held me, and when, after the first four bars, the G sharp came in in the right hand I was completely carried away. Not that he accentuated this G sharp; it was simply that he gave it an entirely new sound which even now, after twenty-seven years, I can hear distinctly. He played the whole of the first movement, then the second; the third he only commenced, saying that he was too old and had not the physical strength for it. I then realized that I had completely forgotten having listened to Rubinstein two hours before. As a pianist he no longer existed. I make this statement deliberately with a full knowledge of what I am saying — and as my readers know my opinion of Rubinstein they may thus gain some faint idea of what Liszt was as a pianist.
